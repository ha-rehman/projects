	        The Department of Computer Science is one of the most prominent and oldest centers of computer education in the country. Its history dates back to the year 1968 when UET Lahore established a Computer Center under the supervision of the Department of Mathematics. The center was equipped with a contemporary IBM 1130 third-generation batch processing system that was equipped with a disk and a monitor. The center was responsible for the teaching courses in Computer Science and Numerical Analysis, which formed an integral part of the curricula for all disciplines of B.Sc. Engineering degrees offered by UET. The center also offered short term computer courses for private and public sector organizations. A Bachelor’s degree program in computer science center was started in 1976. In 1978, the course was upgraded to MSc. Computer Science degree that makes the department the first center in the country to offer a graduate program in computer science. The center became an independent department of Computer Science in 1991. The department holds an endowment chair given by His Majesty Sultan Qaboos Bin Said-Al-Said, Sultan of Oman<br/><br/>

            The Institute was established in 1972. It is the oldest and a premier Institute in the field of Environmental Engineering in Pakistan. It offers BSc, MSc and PhD in the field of Environmental Engineering. In addition, it provides advisory and consulting services to both, national and international organizations, in matters related to Environmental Engineering. Some of these organizations include, UNICEF, ADB, World Bank, UNDP, The Urban Unit, WASA, PHED and others. It is also one of the oldest and most reliable Institute that provides commercial testing services of water, wastewater and air. The Institute remained instrumental in framing National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS) and National Standards for Drinking Water Quality (NSDWQ). Recently it has switched to Outcome Based Education (OBE) system and batches 2013-14 are accredited by Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) on OBE, thus the BSc degree is now recognized by 18 members of Washington Accord including USA, UK, Australia, Canada, Japan, China and others.

             the university of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, established the department of Architectural Engineering and Design during the year 2001. This was the first time that the discipline of Architectural Engineering and Design was introduced in Pakistan. Later on, other institutions in the country also realized the importance of Architectural Engineering and introduced this subject following the U.E.T. pattern. In the beginning, the department was established under the faculty of Architecture and Planning with five years course but later on it was transferred to the faculty of Civil Engineering with four years course.

            Polymers are emerging field of research and industrial commercialization that are finding a wide-spread and fast-growing use ranging from consumer market to specialized industrial and defense applications. In Pakistan, the polymer industry is one of the fastest growing sectors that needs trained manpower and research support. Keeping this in view, the undergraduate degree program in Polymer and Process Engineering was launched, in 2002, under Polymer Engineering Division of the Department of Chemical Engineering. As a result of a far-reaching ambition, and keen vision which led to the realization of the increasingly important role that Polymer Engineering plays in the world today, the university decided to upgrade the division into an independent degree awarding department in January 2006.

            Polymers are emerging field of research and industrial commercialization that are finding a wide-spread and fast-growing use ranging from consumer market to specialized industrial and defense applications. In Pakistan, the polymer industry is one of the fastest growing sectors that needs trained manpower and research support. Keeping this in view, the undergraduate degree program in Polymer and Process Engineering was launched, in 2002, under Polymer Engineering Division of the Department of Chemical Engineering. As a result of a far-reaching ambition, and keen vision which led to the realization of the increasingly important role that Polymer Engineering plays in the world today, the university decided to upgrade the division into an independent degree awarding department in January 2006. Further to this development, the postgraduate degree program in Polymer and Process Engineering was started in 2007.

           The Department of Petroleum and Gas Engineering has the distinction of being the pioneer in the country to offer degree program in Petroleum Engineering. It was first instituted in 1969 as a division of Mining Engineering Department. Realizing the importance of the discipline and the department by the national petroleum sector, a full-fledge department of Petroleum and Gas Engineering was established in 1975.

The students are encouraged to actively participate in different students’ societies: Dramatic Society, Literary Society, Debating Society and Environment and Horticulture Society (EHS). The students are also encouraged to participate in the national and provincial activities under the patronization of Pakistan Council of Architects and Planners (PCATP) and Institute of Architects of Pakistan.

          The Department of Architecture strongly believes that the purpose of university education, above and beyond professional training is opening up of intellectual horizons and to produce enlightened and progressive members of society. SoAAD attempts to achieve these objectives through a winding of knowledge base in the formal curriculum, and exposure to a social and intellectual environment developed and maintained through informal and co-curricular activities. The students are encouraged to actively participate in different students’ societies: Dramatic Society, Literary Society, Debating Society and Environment and Horticulture Society (EHS).

            The history of Department of Chemistry is as old as 1923. It was known as "Science Department" in the days of McLagen Engineering College Lahore, which offered the subjects of chemistry, physics and mathematics to Engineering disciplines. However, an independent Department of Chemistry was established in 1961, when McLagen College of Engineering was upgraded to University, presently University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore. It was a supporting department for teaching applied chemistry courses to engineering disciplines until 1994. The department started M Sc. applied chemistry program in 1995. While the M.Phil an rams in Chemistry were started after 2000.

            The curricula in the University include compulsory and optional subjects. Islamic and Pakistan studies are included in the compulsory subjects. The underlying purpose of teaching this subject to the students of engineering disciplines is to impress upon them the richness of Islamic culture, heritage and civilization and the role played by Islamic ideology in guiding the Muslims of the sub-continent towards their most cherished goal of an independent home land, Pakistan. After inculcating in them the Cultural, Social, Economic, Political and historical aspects of Islamic civilization, the students would be able to protect and promote Islam, not only as a religion but as a system in Pakistan and in the world as well. The department has been offering Ph.D in Islamic Studies since the academic year 2012 successfully.
