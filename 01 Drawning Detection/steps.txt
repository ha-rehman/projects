1=> Download video dataset from youtube.
2=> convert video to images using online tool.
3=> annotate 100 images and train yolo5 on them.
4=> Annotation were not good by intern thats why model rises problems. (i.e. all objects are labels the not drowning class).
5=> convert video to images by frame.py code using frame rate.
6=> annotate 280 images (train=250, val=30).
7=> Train model on the new annotated dataset.


Note: Use yolo5 custom training dataset repo of GitHub.
