History[edit]
In 1969 the Islamic Community in Vienna purchased a 8,300 m2 (89,000 sq ft) plot from the city of Vienna in order to build a mosque. Due to financial difficulties the start of construction had to be postponed several times. In 1975 Saudi king Faisal bin Abdulaziz al Saud pledged to finance the construction of the mosque himself.[1]
After Richard Lugner was selected as general contractor, construction work began on 1 July 1977. On 20 November 1979 the Vienna Islamic Centre was inaugurated by Rudolf Kirchschl√§ger, President of Austria at the time. This event was covered in the local media, such as a report in the Zeit im Bild on the inauguration day.
Mosque[edit]
The Minaret of Vienna Islamic Centre is 32 metres (105 feet) high, while the dome is 16 metres (52 feet) in height and 20 metres (66 feet) in diameter.[2]
