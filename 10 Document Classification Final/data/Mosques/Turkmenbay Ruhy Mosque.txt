Overview[edit]
The mosque, constructed by the French company Bouygues, was built in the home town of President Saparmurat Niyazov. It opened on October 22, 2004 and was built by Niyazov with a mausoleum in preparation for his death. Niyazov died two years later, and was buried in the mausoleum on December 24, 2006.
The mosque has been at the center of controversy as scriptures from both the Quran and the Ruhnama (The Book of the Soul), Niyazov's 'pseudo-spiritual guide to life' are built into the walls. It has outraged many Muslims that the Ruhnama is placed as the Koran's equal. Indeed, despite its capacity to accommodate 10,000 congregants, the mosque is often empty as the Ruhnama inscriptions are considered blasphemous by devout mosquegoers.[3][4]
