Main article: Cloak of Muhammad
This cloak or mantle reached Kirka Sharif when it was donated by the Afghan ruler Ahmed Shah Durrani (1722–1773), the father of modern Afghanistan and founder of the Durrani Empire. The sacred Muslim object itself had been given to Ahmed Shah by the amir of Bukhara around 1768. The cloak is said to have been worn by the Islamic prophet Muhammad during the famous Isra and Mi'raj, or Night Journey, in the year 621.[1][2][3][4] It is one of the most revered relics in the Muslim world.[1]

The mosque's design follows many principles of Islamic architecture and local customs, with the interior being decorated and carved with green marble from Helmand region of Afghanistan. In addition, it has tiles that are mirrored with gilded detailing. The mosque also has a courtyard and gravestone located on the premises of the shrine.
