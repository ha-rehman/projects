History[edit]
It was first built in nineteenth century by a group of Chinese people, called Chin Ho or Hui, mostly from Yunnan Province.[1] The present-day buildings were built later, in Arabic, rather than Chinese-style, except in front of the prayer hall, where there is the Chinese phrase, "清真寺" or qingzhensi, which means a mosque (literally 'temple of purity and truth').[2]
