The Mosque of Omar Ibn Al-Khattab (Spanish transcription Omar Iban Al-Jattab) is a mosque in Maicao, La Guajira, Colombia. It is the third largest mosque in Latin America. It is locally known as "La Mezquita" ("The Mosque"), simply because it is the only mosque in the region. Along with the Dar Alarkan School, they are the centers for the Islamic faith and culture in the region. The mosque was constructed on 17 September 1997,[1] and named after the second Sunni caliph Omar Ibn Al-Khattab. It was designed by the Iranian architect Ali Namazi, built by the civil engineer Oswaldo Vizcaino Fontalvo, using Italian marble for its construction. It can easily accommodate over 1,000 people.
