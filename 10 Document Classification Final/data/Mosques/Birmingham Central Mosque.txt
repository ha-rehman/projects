History[edit]
A golden dome was added to the top of the minaret in 1981.[4] In 1986, the mosque sought and was granted permission to call prayer within certain limits.[5] Between 1988 and 1990, Al-Hijrah School educated children in three rented rooms within the mosque before moving to Midland House in Small Heath.[6]
In 2006, the West Midlands Fire Service put out a fire in the mosque which began in an office in the building. It did not spread far, yet it caused damage to electronics and also destroyed paperwork.[7]
In December 2011 a man was arrested after making a Facebook threat to bomb the mosque.[8]
Following a protest by the English Defence League (EDL) in April 2017, the Birmingham Central Mosque held a tea party with the goal of countering those demonstrations and promoting interfaith dialogue. The tea party ended up receiving more participants than the original EDL march.[9]
