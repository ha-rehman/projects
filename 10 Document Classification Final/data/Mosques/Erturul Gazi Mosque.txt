History[edit]
The mosque was inaugurated in 1998 after the independence of Turkmenistan in 1990. It is named after Ertuğrul, the father of Osman I, founder of the Ottoman Empire, and was built by Hilmi Şenalp.[1]
Several accidental deaths took place during the construction, and this has led to a belief that the mosque is cursed.[2]
Description[edit]
The white marbled building is reminiscent of the Blue Mosque of Istanbul. The mosque accommodates up to 5,000 worshipers at a time.[citation needed]
