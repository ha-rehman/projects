The Abuja National Mosque, also known as the Nigerian National Mosque, is the national mosque of Nigeria. The mosque was built in 1984[1] and is open to the non-Muslim public, except during congregational prayers.
After the demise of the Chief Imam, Sheikh Musa Muhammad, in 2017, the position of a Chief Imam was abolished.[2] On 9 October 2017, four coequal Imams were appointed in his place. The quartet of Sheikh Ahmad Onilewura, Sheikh (Dr) Muhammad Kabir Adam and Sheikh (Prof) Ibrahim Ahmad Maqari and Professor Shehu Ahmad Said Galadanci, was named the Imams of the mosque. Professor Galadanci doubles as the Murshid (Grand Instructor, Spiritual Guide or General Administrator).[3]
Aims Construction Limited was awarded the project of building the mosque and they completed the project in 1985[4]
