History[edit]
The mosque development was started by an Indonesian-Taiwanese couple who own an Indonesian shop around the area where most of the Indonesian workers work at the factories or in households.[3][4] They purchased empty land beside their shop to build a mosque. With the help of funding and lending from various organizations, the mosque could finally be constructed a year later. The mosque was officially opened on 9 June 2013.[5][6] On 24 April 2016, the Taiwan Muslim Association (TMA; Chinese: 台湾輔導穆斯林協會; pinyin: Táiwān Fǔdǎo Mùsīlín Xiéhuì) was established and headquartered at the mosque.[7]
Activities[edit]
Beside hosting the normal five compulsory daily prayers for Muslims, the mosque also regularly holds classes, such as Mandarin language. The mosque also hosts the branch office of the Zakat foundation Dompet Peduli Ummat Daarut Tauhiid (DPU DT) in early 2017.[8] It is also the headquarters of the Taiwan Muslim Association (Chinese: 臺灣輔導穆斯林協會; pinyin: Táiwān Fǔdǎo Mùsīlín Xiéhuì).[9]
