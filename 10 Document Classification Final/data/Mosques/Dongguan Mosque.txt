History[edit]
Restored recently[when?], it was originally built in 1380 and has colorful white arches along the outside of the wide building. It has a green and white dome and two tall minarets.[1] The mosque saw renovations in the late 19th to early 20th century. Shortly after, the mosque suffered heavy damages caused by political conflict. However, it continued to undergo restorations throughout the rest of the 20th century.[2]
Generals Ma Qi and Ma Bufang controlled the Great Dongguan Mosque when they were military governors of Qinghai.[3]
Architecture[edit]
The mosque covers an area of 11,940 square metres. In the Ming period, the mosque consisted of a single courtyard with a worship hall and two multi-storey minarets. The modern mosque is built in Chinese Islamic architectural style and contains elements of western architecture.[2]
