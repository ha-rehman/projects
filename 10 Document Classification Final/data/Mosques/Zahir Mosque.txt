History[edit]
The mosque was built upon the tomb and grave of fallen Kedah warrior that die during Siamese invasion of Kedah.
The design was inspired by the vision of the late Sultan Muhammad Jiwa Zainal Abidin II, who was in turn inspired by the Azizi Mosque of the Langkat Sultanate in North Sumatra.[1] The state's annual Qurʾān-reading competition is held within the premises of the mosque.
