Construction[edit]
The mosque took almost five years to build and cost more than ₤1 million at that time.[1] The architectural firm involved in the construction was the Malaysia-based Booty Edwards & Partners, whereas the consulting firm was the Singapore-based Steen, Sehested and Partners.[2] The construction work began on 4 February 1954.[3] The construction uses 1,500 tons of concrete and 700 tons of steel.[2] The lengths of the foundation piles are between 80–120 feet (24–37 m).[2]
The mosque was inaugurated on 26 September 1958 in conjunction with the 42nd birthday celebration of Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III.[2][1]
Architecture[edit]
The mosque is influenced by Mughal architecture.[3] It was accounted that the design was first conceptualised by Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III and then developed by the commissioned architect Rudolfo Nolli, an Italian sculptor and decorative stonework contractor.[3]
The size of the mosque is about 225 by 86 feet (69 by 26 m) and can accommodate 3,000 worshippers.[3] It has a maximum height of 52 metres (171 ft).[3] The dome is covered with gold. The floors and columns were built of marble from Italy at a cost of S$200,000.[2] The interior houses a chandelier of 15 feet (4.6 m) in diameter and weighing more than three tonnes; it holds 62 fluorescent tubes. The interior is also lighted by an addition of more than 480 tubes.[2] The floors were covered with Axminster carpets, handmade from Belgium and Saudi Arabia.[2][3]
The mosque sits on a 5-acre (2.0 ha) site and almost surrounded by a man-made lagoon. In the middle of the lagoon sits an artificial barge which was built in 1967 to commemorate the 1,400th anniversary of Nuzul Al-Quran, a holiday in the Islamic calendar which commemorates the revelation of the first verses of the Qur'an. It is designed to resemble the Mahligai barge of the 16th century Sultan Bolkiah.[3]
