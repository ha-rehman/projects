History[edit]
The first mosque on Mount Carmel was built in 1931. Mahmood Mosque was built in the 1970s. It is named after the second Khalifa of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad.
The mosque has two white minarets standing 35 metres tall, which dominate the skyline of the residential neighbourhoods on the ridges nearby. Construction of the mosque was funded by members of the local Ahmadiyya community, which moved to Kababir from Ni'lin, a village near Jerusalem.
Kababir is a mixed neighbourhood of Muslim Arabs and Jews on Mount Carmel.[1] In 1928, most of the residents belonged to the Muslim community[citation needed].
