The Great Mosque of Touba (French: Grande Mosquée de Touba) is a mosque in Touba, Senegal. It was founded by Amadou Bamba in 1887 and completed in 1963. Bamba died in 1927 and is interred inside the mosque.[1] Since his death the mosque is being controlled by his family. It is the largest building in the city and one of the largest mosques in Africa, with a capacity of 7,000.[1] It is the site of a pilgrimage, the Grand Magal of Touba.
It is the home of the Mouride Brotherhood, a Sufi order, thus making it important in Sufism.

History[edit]
The construction of the great mosque at Touba was conceived in the final years of Amadu Bamba's life, around 1924-27; he also chose it as the location for his tomb. Senegal's colonial rulers of the time, the French, agreed the scheme in 1926, albeit 'after some hesitation'. Construction was delayed by the misappropriation of the first round of funds and then, under the direction of Mamadu Mustafâ Mbacke, Bamba's son and successor, proceeded only very slowly. In 1932 the foundations were completed; work paused in 1939-1947; and the building was inaugurated in 1963. Mamadu Mustafâ was also entombed there.[2]
Design[edit]
The mosque is 100 metres long and 80 metres wide. It has five minarets, three large domes and eleven other domes, and two ablution chambers. The central minaret is 96 metres (315 feet) tall.[2]
The immediate vicinity of the mosque houses the mausoleum of Amadou Bamba’s sons, the caliphs of the Mouride order. Other important institutions in the center of the holy city include a library boasting 160,000 volumes,[2] the Caliph’s official audience hall, a sacred “Well of Mercy”, and a cemetery.
The Great Minaret of the Great Mosque of Touba is also commonly referred to as Lamp Fall, which was named by the second Mouride caliph in honour of Sheikh Ibrahima Fall (the founder of the Baye Fall community).[3]
Burial[edit]
Amadou Bamba is buried inside the mosque.
