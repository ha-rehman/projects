Dzhumaya Mosque is located in Plovdiv, Plovdiv Province, Bulgaria. Its Turkish name is Hüdavendigâr Camii or Cuma Camii. The mosque is located in the centre of Plovdiv and was built in 1363–1364 on the site of the Sveta Petka Tarnovska Cathedral Church after the conquest of Plovdiv by the Ottoman army. During the reign of Sultan Murad I in the 15th century the old building was demolished and replaced by the modern-day mosque. It was called Ulu Dzhumaya Mosque, or Main Friday Mosque.[1]
The mosque is large, with nine domes and a 33 m × 27 m (108 ft × 89 ft) prayer hall. There is a minaret at the northeast corner of the main façade. Interior wall paintings date to the late 18th to early 19th centuries.[1]
2014 attack[edit]
The mosque was attacked by a mob described as "hundreds of nationalists, fascists and football hooligans"[2] in February 2014.[3][4] 120 were "detained" after the attack[4] and four received minor sentences.[3] The Grand Mufti of Bulgaria, Mustafa Haci, characterized the attack as a "pogrom."[2]
