History[edit]
Abul Abbas al-Mursi died in 1286 and was buried here. The mosque was first built in 1307.
The mosque was designed and built in today's current form by Eugenio Valzania and Mario Rossi in the years 1929/1945, and was highly influenced by Egypt's Old Cairo buildings and architecture.
It served in turn as a key source of inspiration for the much larger Sheikh Zayed Mosque in Abu Dhabi, completed in 2007 after more than a decade of building work.[1][2]
