Mosque Maryam, also known as Muhammad Mosque #2 or Temple #2, is the headquarters of the Nation of Islam, located in Chicago, Illinois. It is at 7351 South Stony Island Avenue in the South Shore neighborhood.[1] Louis Farrakhan's headquarters are in the premises. The building was originally the Saints Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox Church before it relocated to suburban Palos Hills. Elijah Muhammad purchased the building in 1972. Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had also lent Elijah Muhammad, his predecessor as head of the Nation of Islam, $3 million to convert the former Greek Orthodox church in Chicago into the Mosque Maryam.[2]

Design[edit]
The main prayer hall is unusual for a mosque, since it was originally the church's nave that contained pews later replaced with seats,[3] whereas mosques usually have only an open floor space to spread prayer rugs on which to kneel.
Mosque Maryam serves as the headquarters and National Center for the Nation of Islam. Adjacent to the mosque is the Muhammad University of Islam, an educational institute for boys and girls from preschool through 12th grade.
