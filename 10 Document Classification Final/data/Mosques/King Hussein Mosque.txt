King Hussein Bin Talal Mosque, better known as the King Hussein Mosque, is the largest mosque in Jordan.[1] Not to be confused with the 1924 Grand Al-Husseini Mosque, also known as King Hussein Mosque, in Downtown Amman.
King Hussein Mosque was built in 2005 in the reign of King Abdullah II in West Amman, specifically in Al Hussein Public Parks at King Abdullah II Street near King Hussein Medical Center. The mosque is located at an altitude of 1,013 metres (3,323 ft) above sea level and can thus be seen from most parts of Amman. It is square and features four minarets and marble floors.[2]
In 2012, King Abdullah opened the Museum of the Prophet (Arabic: متحف الرسول, Matḥaf ar-Rusūl), which houses a number of relics associated with the Islamic prophet Muhammad.[3]
