History[edit]
Pushkalavati was the first capital of Gandhara from 6th to 1st century BC and the former name of Charsadda District,[1] which is situated 30 km to the northeast of Peshawar District. Remainder of Pushkalavati can be seen around the site of Balahisar. The city goddess was also called Pushkalwati. The term Pushkalavati (Sanskrit) is a combination of two Prakrit words Pushkara or Pushkala which mean lotus (a type of flower) and 'wati or vati', mean city so Pushkalavati mean that the Lotus City.[2] The lotus flower, which also represented Buddha in primitive sect, is still grown in Charsadda area which is a very fertile and the city had around ponds full of lotus flowers. The Syama Jataka also took place. The legendary Hariti Devi and Panchika were born here and converted to Buddhism by Buddha.[3][4][5][6][7]
