The museum temporarily hosted the sarcophagus of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk from 1938 to 1953, during the period of the construction of Anıtkabir, his final resting place.

Temporary resting place of Atatürk[edit]
Following Atatürk's death on November 10, 1938 at Dolmabahçe Palace, Istanbul, his remains were transferred on November 19 by sea on the battlecruiser TCG Yavûz[1] to Izmit and subsequently by train[2] to Ankara, arriving on November 20.[3] The casket was placed on a catafalque in the front of the Turkish Grand National Assembly building for Atatürk's state funeral.[4] On November 21, 1938, his body was transported on a horse-drawn caisson to the Ethnography Museum of Ankara. British,[5] Iranian[6] and Yugoslavian[7] guards of honor escorted the cortège to the museum.
Atatürk's mahogany casket was placed inside a white marble sarcophagus where it remained for nearly 15 years. On November 4, 1953, after the completion of Anıtkabır, his sarcophagus was opened in the presence of Parliament speaker Refik Koraltan, Prime Minister Adnan Menderes, Chief of General Staff Nuri Yamut and other officials. The casket was removed and placed on a catafalque in the museum, where it remained until November 10, 1953 on the 15th anniversary of his death. It was transferred to Anıtkabir on the same day, escorted by military honors on a caisson in a cortège.[8]
