A corner is dedicated to Sabiha Gökçen, which contains her private belongings related to her aviation career. Another corner is reserved for Turkish female aviators.[2]
In a building provided in 1999 by the TUAF Logistics Command and named Mavi Dünya ("The Blue World"), cockpits of Lockheed T-33 and Northrop F-5 aircraft are placed, which visitors can take a seat in.[2]
