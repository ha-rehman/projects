History[edit]
In 1969, a small single-room museum was established with exhibits including coins, farming tools, pottery, and weapons. On 27 May 1991, Sheikh Hamad bin Mohammed Al Sharqi issued a decree to establish a Department of Antiquities and Heritage for the Emirate of Fujairah, including maintenance of the museum and its collection. On 30 November 1991, the ruler of Fujairah officially opened the museum. In 1998, the Department completed museum expansion plans with two large halls covering antiquities and three halls for heritage.
