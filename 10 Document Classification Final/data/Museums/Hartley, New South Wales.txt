History[edit]
Main article: Hartley historic site
Hartley was formerly a judicial and administrative centre that had a busy courthouse. The courthouse was built in 1837 and was designed by prominent New South Wales Colonial Architect Mortimer Lewis.[3] The courthouse, which operated for over fifty years, dealt with a constant stream of robbers, thieves and convicts. Although Hartley fell into disuse, it survived as a perfectly preserved village that is a superb example of 19th century architecture. Because of its heritage value, it is now preserved as a historic site, administered by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of New South Wales.[4] Situated 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) west of Mount Victoria and 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) south of Lithgow, it is open to the public every day (except Christmas Day and Easter Sunday). The Hartley Historic Site, an area of 7.7 hectares (19 acres), is listed on the Register of the National Estate.[5]
Hartley's sister villages, Little Hartley and Hartley Vale, still survive as residential villages with a heritage of their own. Little Hartley, situated 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) south-east of Hartley, is the site of the historic home Rosedale. Hartley Vale, situated 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) east of Hartley, is the site of the Comet Inn, Collits Inn and Hartley Vale cemetery.[6][7] There is also a network of historic walking tracks between Hartley Vale and Mount York, administered by the Lands Department of New South Wales.[8]
