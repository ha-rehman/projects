Baksı Museum is a museum located in Bayburt, Turkey. “Baksı” literally means “healer, helper, protector” in the West Asia. The museum offers contemporary art and traditional handcrafts. The basic aim of the foundation is, as quoted by founder Professor Hüsamettin Koçan, to "disseminate art and culture by bringing together contemporary and traditional art, to collect, document, classify, preserve and promote works of contemporary and traditional art, to use this base in realizing creation, and to hand local and national cultural values down to future generations".[1]

History[edit]
It sprouted as a dream of Bayburt-born artist and academy Professor. Dr. Hüsamettin Koçan in 2000. This project is the result of an effort to carry life to Husamettin Koçan's lands. Baksı Culture and Art Foundation was founded in 2005 in order to make this idea come to life. The museum has turned into a truly social project over the years with the contribution of many volunteers, especially artists.
The main building of the museum was completed in 2010 after a tough adventure without any financial assistance from the state. The presentation of the Baksı Museum was held in Istanbul Modern in June 2010 and the opening was in July. In 2012, the Warehouse Museum, the new exhibition hall of the museum, met with art lovers.[2]
