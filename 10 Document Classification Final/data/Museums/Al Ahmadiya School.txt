Al Ahmadiya School was a semi-formal private school in Al Ras, Dubai, United Arab Emirates, which is now owned and managed as a museum by the Dubai Culture & Arts Authority.[1][2]
History[edit]
The school was founded in the year 1912 by Sheikh Ahmed Bin Dalmouk, of the pearl trade in the Persian Gulf. Following his demise, his son Sheikh Mohammed Bin Ahmed Bin Dalmouk completed the construction of the school and named it Al Ahmadiya School in honor of his father. The Dubai government worked on the restoration of Al Ahmadiya School in mid-1994 and converted it into a museum that was inaugurated by His Highness Sheikh Hamdan Bin Rashid Al Maktoum on March 20, 2000, representing the genesis of semi-formal education in Dubai.
