History[edit]
The museum is housed in an 18th-century building. During the Ottoman Empire era, a part of the ground floor was used as a coffeehouse and another part as a hardware store. The upper floor served as a hotel. During the Turkish War of Independence, the building was turned into the headquarters of the local militia forces. During the early years of the Turkish Republic, it was used as a Halkevi building and later an officers club.[2]
Burhaniye Municipality restored the building and opened it as a museum on 24 November 2008.[3]
Exhibited items[edit]

In the section of coinage and ceramics, tweezers, brooch, earring, necklace and pins are also exhibited.
