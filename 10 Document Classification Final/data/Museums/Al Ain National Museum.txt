Description and history[edit]
The museum, the oldest in the UAE, is located next to the Eastern Fort (or Sultan Bin Zayed Fort).[2][3] It is on the eastern side of the Al Ain Oasis, the largest oasis in Al Ain. It was built by the former UAE President, Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, to house archaeological finds from the surrounding area, including the Hafit-era 'beehive' tombs near Mezyad.[4] The museum was inaugurated by Sheikh Tahnoun bin Mohammed Al Nahyan, the Ruler's Representative in the Eastern Region, on 2 November 1971.[5]
The museum has two main sections on ethnographic and archaeological aspects of the country, especially around Al Ain. It includes finds from the Bronze Age tombs at the Mezyad[4] and Hili Archaeological Parks on the outskirts of Al Ain.[6]
As of October 2018, there were plans to make restorations to the museum and fort.[7]
