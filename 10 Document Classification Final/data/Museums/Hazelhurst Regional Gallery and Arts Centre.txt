History[edit]
Hazelhurst is an initiative of the Sutherland Shire Council and was created by the bequest of Ben and Hazel Broadhurst. The land that became Hazelhurst was secured in 1945, where a two-storey cottage, designed with the help of local architect Harry Smith, was built. The cottage is now used as Hazelhurst's artist-in-residence and digital media studio.
