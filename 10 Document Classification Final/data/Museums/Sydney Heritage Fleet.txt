History[edit]
The Lady Hopetoun and Port Jackson Marine Steam Museum was the forerunner of the Sydney Heritage Fleet. In 1965 a group of enthusiasts under Warwick Turner, formed the museum to preserve Sydney's 1902 VIP steam yacht Lady Hopetoun.[3][4] The organisation later became known as the Sydney Maritime Museum Ltd. In 1998 the museum adopted the trading name Sydney Heritage Fleet, except for two years (2003/4) when 'Australian Heritage Fleet' (more accurately reflecting the fleets make up, for example the SS John Oxley has no connection to Sydney harbour) was used.[5] The Fleet now comprises 10 historic vessels which is amongst the largest collections of its type in the world.[6]
Organisation[edit]
The Sydney Heritage Fleet is supported by a membership of 1,200, with over 15 paid workers and 200 volunteer workers who restore, operate and maintain the fleet and preserve traditional maritime methods and skills. In addition to the 10 primary vessels being operated or restored, the Fleet also has 55 small heritage boats and a significant collection of marine engines under restoration, as well as a collection of over fifty model ships. A comprehensive research library and archive which includes photographs, ships' plans, diaries, logs and journals is also maintained. [6]
Funding is through donations, membership subscriptions and income from vessel charters and tours.[6]
