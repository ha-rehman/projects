Philosophy[edit]
Salsali Private Museum is a contribution to the unique process of the development of the United Arab Emirates and Dubai as an evolving hub for the art and culture of the Middle East.
Founder[edit]
Ramin Salsali started his collection at the age of 21 and has been developing it ever since. Born in Tehran in 1964, he studied economics, strategic management, and marketing with a focus on Industry Design in Germany and England.
In April 2011, Salsali decided to realize his long-term dream by establishing a private museum in Dubai. Salsali Private Museum [SPM] opened its doors on 11.11.2011. SPM is the first private museum for contemporary art in the region, in which Salsaliâ€™s collection of over 900 pieces of painting, photography, video art, sculpture, and installation art are showcased.
Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai has recognized and honored Salsali as Patron of the Arts for the consecutive years, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 for his sustained support of the art community in Dubai. Ramin's depth of experience and refreshing approach to the art collection process will be inspiring to both established and emerging collectors.[1]
