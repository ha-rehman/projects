Tyrannosaurus rex[edit]
The main attraction for tourists and enthusiasts is the 10Â½ metre long and 4-metre high Tyrannosaurus rex (T.Rex) skeleton.[3] In addition, the Museum houses Australia's largest collection of fossils in amber, fossil dinosaur eggs, and a large collection of opalised fossils.
The Somerville Collection[edit]
The Somerville Collection is approximately one third fossil and two-thirds mineral specimens and is features some of the finest and rarest examples of minerals from around the world and scientifically significant fossils from Australia.
Highlights from the mineral collection include minerals from over 100 Australian mine sites, 2000 million year old garnets,[4] as well as diamonds, sapphires, rubies, and emeralds. Three dinosaur skeletons are displayed as well as a sabre-tooth cat skull, dinosaur egg fossils and some of the oldest fossils of early forms of life. Also in the collection is an extremely rare fossilised Gecko trapped in amber between 30 and 24 million years ago.[3] in the Oligocene epoch on the geological time scale.
The Museum houses the lifetime collection of Warren Somerville AM.

Somerville has been collecting specimens from around the world for 60 years. In 2000, Warren Somerville donated this priceless legacy to the people of Australia.
