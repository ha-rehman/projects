History and events[edit]
The airfield was established in 1977 with the aim of restoring and operating vintage aircraft. A company specialising in the repair and restoration of early de Havilland aircraft was later established and has operated from a hangar on the airfield for over 30 years.[2]
On 1 May 1994, a visiting Tiger Moth lost engine power and crashed while performing a wing walking demonstration at Luskintyre. Both the pilot and the wing-walker were killed in the accident.[3]
In October 2003, Tiger Moths from Luskintyre participated in The Great Tiger Moth Air Race, an event celebrating 100 years of powered flight and sponsored by aircraft manufacturer Airbus.[4] In September 2010, the airfield hosted flying displays and events coinciding with the 100th anniversary of the first de Havilland aircraft.
'Lunch with the Tiger Moths' is a regular event held on the first Saturday of each month (weather permitting). The event allows visitors to inspect airworthy and under-restoration Tiger Moths and view the museum's collection of memorabilia.[1]
Many recreational pilots as well as professional pilots use the airfield. It is also frequented by aerobatic champion Paul Bennet, and his formation flying team the SkyAces.
