History[edit]
Bumburet Valley Museum, also known as the Kalasha dur (House of the Kalasha People or Cultural Centre for the Kalasha). Kalasha Dur is a place where a number of collected objects could be displayed. Most of these objects were collected by the members of the N.G.O. (Non Governmental Organization) called the "Greek Volunteers¬ù" based in Greece. They had been working in the Kalasha dur valleys since 1995.[2][4][5][6][7][8]
Ethnological collection[edit]
The building is composed of two floors; the ground floor has the Ethnological collection of the Kalasha culture and the wider hindu kush area and the other floor houses a school of Kalasha culture with a library of books written on the valley, and also a hall for professional training of local crafts. The members of the "Greek Volunteers" were responsible for much of the collection exhibited in the museum. Volunteers would visit the Kalasha Valleys with a view to buying traditional objects or to exchange them with modern ones. A lot of worry and anxiety were caused to the members of the "Greek Volunteers" when they noticed that the New Kalasha Generation would never see the traditional objects of their ancestors. This observation started the buying of objects, clothes and other typical items so that they will not go out of the valleys. Their first aim was to exhibit all these objects in an Ethnological Museum, so future generations will able to see and learn about the life of their ancestors. Later on, when the Kalasha Dur Museum was built the number of the collected objects started to increase. The many offerings by the Kalasha people and inhabitants of the Kalasha valleys to their Museum, has increased the number of items above those purchased. The Museum also purchased traditional utensils and other objects which had left the settlements of the Hindu Kush, from the antique shops of Peshawar and Chitral to enrich their collection.[2][5]
