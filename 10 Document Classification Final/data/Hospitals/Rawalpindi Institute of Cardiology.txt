History[edit]
In October 2005, the establishment of Rawalpindi Institute of Cardiology (RIC) was approved by the CM Punjab Chaudhry Parvez Elahi government of the Punjab.[1] At the cost of Rs.2.75 billion,[2] the construction was started in June 2010.[3] The then-Chief Minister of Punjab, Shahbaz Sharif, said that the project would be completed within a year, although shortage of funds meant that this timescale was not met.[1] According to Hanif Abbasi – a former Pakistan Muslim League-N Member of the National Assembly – the provincial government provided Rs.100 million for the project.[4] The Chief Minister then announced that RIC would be inaugurated by 14 August 2012,[5] but once again the deadline was missed due to the delay in installation of the equipment. Medical Superintendent of the RIC Dr. Shoaib Khan told "that the project had not been delayed but the health department had delayed the inauguration function due to Ramazan and some important engagements of the chief minister."[6]
