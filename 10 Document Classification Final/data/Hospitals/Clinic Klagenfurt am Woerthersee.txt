History[edit]
Klagenfurt Hospital was opened on August 9, 1896.[1] State charities were newly built and opened at that time. These included the state hospital in Klagenfurt, the insane asylum, the children's hospital, the state hospital, the deaf and dumb and blind institution, the men's blind home and the state sick house.[2]
During World War II the hospital was used by the Nazis to murder 700 to 900 patients. Antonie Pachner, the head nurse along with other nurses and the primary teacher of the men's department of the State Asylum Institute, Franz Niedermoser, administered lethal doses of sedatives to many patients. Four death transports to the Hartheim killing center between 1940 and 1941 caused the deaths of 733 people, including 25 children.[2]
In 2019, the new medical directors, Dietmar Alberer and Elke Schindler, were focused on the construction of a new psychiatric facility.[3]
