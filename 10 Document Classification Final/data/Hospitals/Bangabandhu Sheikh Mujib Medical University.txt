History[edit]
Establishment of the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University was an upgrade of the Institute of Postgraduate Medicine and Research (IPGMR). IPGMR was established in December 1965, as a Government-controlled postgraduate institute for medical research and studies. It was housed in the now defunct Hotel Shahbag, once the biggest hotel in Dhaka. The neighbourhood got its name Shahbag from the name of the hotel.[citation needed]
From 2010, many of the medical and public health colleges/institutes have become affiliated to BSMMU. For example BIRDEM, BIHS, DMC, SSMC, NICVD, NITOR and others.[citation needed]
