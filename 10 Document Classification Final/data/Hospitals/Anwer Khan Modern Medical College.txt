Admission for Bangladeshis to the MBBS programmes at all medical colleges in Bangladesh (government and private) is conducted centrally by the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS). It administers a written multiple choice question exam simultaneously throughout the country. Candidates are admitted based primarily on their score on this test, although grades at Secondary School Certificate (SSC) and Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC) level also play a part.[8] As of September 2015, the college is allowed to admit 110 students annually.[1] Foreign students have to score high in GRE to get this college for post graduation (MD/MS).

It accepts original research articles, review articles on topics of current interest, interesting case reports, and short communications on small topics.
