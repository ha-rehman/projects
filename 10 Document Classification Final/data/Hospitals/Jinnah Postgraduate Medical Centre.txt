History and background[edit]
After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the founder of the nation, Muhammad Ali Jinnah was asked for approval to lend his name to the hospital. Jinnah granted the approval with the condition that the hospital be opened to the public.
In 1952, Dow Medical College was attached with the Jinnah Central Hospital. Then after a consolidation of many departments and laboratories in the area, an updated medical institution was opened. The opening ceremony was a big event on 11 April 1959 with President of Pakistan Ayub Khan addressing the audience on the occasion.[2]
In 2007, then Prime Minister of Pakistan Shaukat Aziz formally spoke at the foundation-stone laying ceremony of JPMC Medical Towers and a five-star hotel project.[4]
