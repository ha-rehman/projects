History[edit]
The hospital traces its origins to 1858, when it was founded with the help of donations given by Shri Hutheesing, Shri Premabhai and Surgeon General D Wyllie, for a total cost of 96,000. It had rooms for 92 inpatients.[1] Every year, the hospital admits around 70,000 patients, conducts 26,000 surgeries, and performs 6,500 deliveries.[2]
Working[edit]
In 2019, the hospital inaugurated a new 1,200-bed building within the campus, built at a cost of Rs 395 crore.[3] Earlier that month, hundreds of contractual employees of the hospital protested the incomplete payment of salaries.[4]
COVID-19 pandemic in Gujarat[edit]
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Gujarat High Court highlighted the poor health infrastructure of the hospital, calling conditions in the hospital "pathetic" and "as good as a dungeon", highlighting the lack of ventilators and lack of accountability by senior physicians.[5][6] After a few days, a new bench of the High Court noted that "administration has geared up and is doing quite well" after observing that the hospital had additional healthcare staff along with 47 ventilators.[7]
