History[edit]
Saint Marys Hospital was founded in 1889 by a local Franciscan religious community, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Rochester, Minnesota, led by Mother Alfred Moes.[7] Five buildings at the Saint Marys Campus are named to honor Saint Marys' foundress and first administrator, Mother Alfred, and four Sisters who previously served as hospital administrators: Sisters Joseph, Domitilla, Mary Brigh and Generose.[8] The Francis Building honors the many Franciscan Sisters who have served since the founding of Saint Marys.
Originally, the name was spelled "Saint Mary's Hospital", as can be seen in stone above the old front entrance, but in recent years the apostrophe is usually omitted.
In January 2014, Saint Marys and Rochester Methodist were consolidated under the name Mayo Clinic Hospital – Rochester.[9][10]
