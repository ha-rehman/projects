History[edit]
During the later part of British Raj, it was felt that what was then Campbell Medical School of Calcutta and Mitford Medical School of Dhaka were unable to cater the needs of the growing population. As a result, in 1924 the Earl of Lytton, then-governor of Bengal, established the school in Mymensingh unde the name "Lytton Medical School". As a four-year college for the Licentiate of Medical Faculty (LMF). This course of LMF continued till 1962, when the undergraduate course length was increased to five years under Dhaka University and the school was renamed as Mymensingh Medical College.[3]
