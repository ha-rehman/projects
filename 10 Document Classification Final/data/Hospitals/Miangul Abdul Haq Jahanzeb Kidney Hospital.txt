History[edit]
To assist in the rebuilding of the war and flood-ravaged basic infrastructure of Swat, this hospital was built using funds from Punjab Hospitals' trust in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. It is the first-ever Kidney Hospital in the province. The contract was awarded to M/S Tijaarat Developers.[4][5]
Groundbreaking of the project was formally performed by Former Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif, and Ishaq Dar, the then leader of opposition in the Senate on 28 November 2012.[6]
Renaming[edit]
The hospital was renamed to Miangul Abdul Haq Jahanzeb Kidney Hospital by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government in 2021 despite protests by Nawaz Sharif's party members.[7] Doctors at the hospital however had no issue with it being renamed. They said that it had been named after Nawaz Sharif because of his commitment to run it for at least three years. He didn’t fulfill the pledge he had made and the provincial government was required to upgrade it because it was a ray of hope for patients, who had to travel to Peshawar for dialysis and other surgeries related to kidney ailments, they added. [8]
According to the government officials in Peshawar, the decision to name the kidney centre after Nawaz Sharif was made in violation of rules of business of the Administration Department that national assets could not be named after a living person. [9]
