History[edit]
Saifee Hospital is a project of the Saifee Hospital Trust. The Saifee Hospital was earlier called the Sughrabai Millwallah Hospital. It was established and managed by the Dawoodi Bohra Community. Karimbhai Millwallah Trust made a donation to the Saify Co-operative Housing Society Limited. for a piece of land which was allotted in 1959. Thus, the Sughrabai Millwallah Hospital was constructed and served as a small maternity clinic till 1971 under the management of the Saify Co-operative Housing Society Limited. In the same year the Housing Society handed the hospital back to the Karimbhai Millwallah Trust, which made arrangements with Pakistan Medico International which managed the hospital for the next 20 years, before handing it back to the Saify Housing Society.
Rapid expansion followed and an application was made to the Karachi Development Authority (KDA) to transfer both land and property of the hospital to Syedna Tahir Sayf-al-Din Memorial Foundation. It was then that the hospital was named Saifee Hospital. In July 1994, the hospital was handed over to the Burhani Board which managed the hospital till its establishment as an independent Trust now called the Saifee Hospital Trust.
