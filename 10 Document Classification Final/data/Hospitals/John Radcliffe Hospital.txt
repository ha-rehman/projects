History[edit]
The distinctive large white-tiled structure occupies a prominent position on Headington Hill, on the outskirts of Oxford.[1]
JR1: This was the initial hospital building, opened in 1972. It houses women's services and neonatology. The second building, JR2, opened in 1979 and is much larger. It contains most of the other specialist services for the region.[2] Other facilities were then added to the site, including the University of Oxford's Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) of the Brain.[3]
The West Wing: With the closure of the Radcliffe Infirmary and consolidation of the other hospital sites in Oxford, a further large expansion took place, the facilities for which were procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract in 2003. The works, which were designed by Austin-Smith:Lord and undertaken by Carillion at a cost of £134 million, were completed in December 2006.[4] This new complex, known as the West Wing, involved the construction of the new Oxford Children's Hospital, the relocated Oxford Eye Hospital, and the departments of neurosciences/head and neck and of Ear Nose & Throat (ENT).[5] The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh officially commemorated the opening of the new West Wing and Children's Hospital at a special ceremony in late November 2008 in front of patients, staff, fundraisers and supporters who had helped raise the £15 million needed to build the Children's Hospital.[6] In 2017 the Oxford University Natural History Museum donated a model Utahraptor for the entrance to the Children's Hospital.[7]
