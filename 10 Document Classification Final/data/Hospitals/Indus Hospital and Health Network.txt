The Indus Hospital and Health Network formerly Indus Hospitals is a tertiary care multidisciplinary hospital and healthcare system in Pakistan. Construction began in 2004 and it opened in July 2007. It is located in Korangi. It is the first paperless hospital in the country; the hospital has an e-cardiology system.[1]
It is privately run but offers services free of charge. The idea of a "free public hospital" was conceived by four medical students after they visited the 1987 Bohri Bazaar bomb blast site and experienced much frustration by the limited capacity of the nearby Civil Hospital Karachi's emergency ward.

Facilities[edit]
The hospital itself serves mainly the adjoining areas of Korangi and Landhi with a population of 2.5 million in its 5 kilometre radius. But it also receives patients from the rest of Karachi.[3] This hospital is governed and funded by a philanthropic foundation. Indus Hospital mainly operates on donations from friends and supporters of its services. It provides free treatment including some medicines.[1] The phase one of this five billion rupee project has been completed and made functional with 150-bed in-patient accommodation. In 2014, Indus Hospital treats 1500 patients every day for free.[3]
First paperless hospital in Pakistan[edit]
It is the first ever paperless hospital established in Pakistan with a very user-friendly hospital management information system that was developed in-house.[4] All of the medical records including history, examination, investigations, radiological images & reports, electrocardiographies, dialysis sessions, operative notes, nursing record like fluid balance charting and vital signs monitoring, etc. are recorded directly on to the computers with no element of hard copies. "E-cardiology at the Indus Hospital uses text and multimedia messages to transfer information."[3]
Free artificial limbs facility launched[edit]
In March 2015, a rehabilitation centre for handicapped people was launched. This facility was developed with the help of International Committee of Red Cross and Chal Foundation (Walk Foundation).[5] Between 2000 and 2500 artificial limbs will be manufactured and fitted to patients free of cost every year. The hospital will also counsel and train disabled persons.[6]
