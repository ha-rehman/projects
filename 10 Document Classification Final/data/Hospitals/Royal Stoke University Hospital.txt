History[edit]
The first hospital on the site, known as the Parish Hospital, was completed in 1842.[2] This facility evolved to become the London Road Hospital and Institution by the early 20th century and became the City General Hospital in 1945.[2] It joined the National Health Service in 1948.[3]
New facilities were procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract to replace the both the City General Hospital and the North Staffordshire Royal Infirmary in 2007. The works, which were designed Ryder / HKS[4] and carried out by Laing O'Rourke at a cost of Â£370 million[5] on the old City General Hospital site, were completed August 2012.[6]
