History[edit]
Oslo University Hospital was established on 1 January 2009 by the merger of three state-owned university hospitals in Oslo, all of which were affiliated with the University of Oslo:
Rikshospitalet (The National Hospital; founded 1826)
Ullevål University Hospital (founded 1887)
Aker University Hospital (founded 1895)
Rigshospitalet (the pre-1907 spelling) was established as Norway's national teaching hospital affiliated with the university in 1826, mainly on the basis on the Military Hospital that had been established during the Napoleonic Wars in 1807.[2] Rigshospitalet also incorporated Akershus Regional Hospital, founded 1756. The hospital's academic tradition dates back to the establishment of the Faculty of Medicine of the Royal Frederick University in 1814, which itself was a continuation of the traditions of the University of Copenhagen and Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen following the 1814 Dano–Norwegian split. In the late 19th century the Norwegian Parliament decided to develop Rigshospitalet as a "model hospital" that would be comparable to the world's then-leading hospitals, such as Germany's Charité. As a result the hospital was massively expanded to become one of the most modern hospitals in the world, and a major research institution. Ullevål Hospital was established in 1887 and was a teaching hospital affiliated with the university from its very first years. During the 20th century Ullevål Hospital became Oslo's main municipal hospital, one of the largest hospitals in Scandinavia and a major medical research institution and teaching hospital. Aker Hospital was established in 1895 and became a teaching hospital affiliated with the university in 1948. Ullevål and Aker were transferred from the Oslo city government to the national government in 2002.Oslo University Hospital's predecessor institutions also include several specialized hospitals, such as the psychiatric hospital Gaustad Hospital (founded 1855), which was merged into Aker Hospital in 1996, and the Crown Princess Märtha Institute, Sophies Minde, the Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases, the Hospital for Epilepsy, the Hospital for Rehabilitation, Oslo Heart Centre and the Norwegian Radium Hospital, all of which were merged into Rikshospitalet.University of Oslo currently has two university hospitals, Oslo University Hospital and Akershus University Hospital. Oslo University Hospital is the oldest and largest of the two.[citation needed]
Oslo University Hospital has 1,870 beds as of 2018, which is set to increase to 2,300 by 2028.[3]
