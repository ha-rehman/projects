History[edit]
The hospital network was founded in 1956 focusing on Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). The hospital uses TCM to treat diseases "of the spleen and stomach, cough, asthma, insomnia, diabetes, enuresis, chronic fatigue syndrome, facial paralysis, protrusion of lumbar intervertebral disc, sciatica, dysmenorrhea, acne, and fatty liver".[3]
Beijing International Acupuncture Training Center, a subsidiary of Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, has been visited and studied by roughly 30,000 people from over 80 countries.[4]
In 2017, president of the Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Liu Quanqing, warned against using "anti-smog" herbal teas to combat smog related illness stating it is ineffective and "may even cause additional health risks". Liu warned that "anti-smog" tea contained "ingredients that are medicines and can't be used as food, which may cause health problems if taken for a long time". He also "suggested remedies for cleaning the lungs, such as eating kelp, radish or wood-ear fungus" were not genuine.[5][6]
A joint venture involving Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine set up Ming Yi Guan, the first "treatment facility outside China".[7]
