The college admits only female students.[10] Admission for Bangladeshis to the MBBS programmes at all medical colleges in Bangladesh (government and private) is conducted centrally by the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS). It administers a written multiple choice question exam simultaneously throughout the country. Candidates are admitted based primarily on their score on this test, although grades at Secondary School Certificate (SSC) and Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC) level also play a part.[11] Seats are reserved for daughters of Freedom Fighters, and 5% of seats are reserved for students from underprivileged backgrounds.[12] As of July 2014, the college is allowed to admit 75 students annually.[13]
