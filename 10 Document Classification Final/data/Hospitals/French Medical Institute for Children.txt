The French Medical Institute for Mothers and Children (FMIC) is a tertiary hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan, established in 2006 through a unique partnership between the government of France, Government of Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, The Aga Khan Development Network and the French NGO La Chaîne de L’Espoir/Chain of Hope.[1] The institute is also a technology lead, having implemented eHealth solutions including tele-consultations via a network of Aga Khan Development Network centres in the region and the Aga Khan University.[2]
In 2006, FMIC conducted the first open-heart paediatric cardiac surgery in Afghanistan. The patient was a 13-year-old girl named Elaha, whose family was charged a nominal amount for the major operation.[3] In 2012, construction at FMIC began on a new 52 bed wing for obstetric and gynaecologic care and a 14-bed neonatal intensive care unit - the first in Afghanistan. A ceremony marking the start of construction was attended by the Aga Khan IV, Karim Khalili, Afghanistan's vice president, and Laurent Fabius, Minister of Foreign Affairs of France.[4]
FMIC has beds for 169 patients, including 15 intensive care beds for children, 17 beds for adult cardiac patients, 28 beds for maternal care, 8 beds for adult orthopaedics, 31 beds for adult medicine, 56 beds allocated for paediatric medical, surgical and orthopaedic units and 14 beds for its Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.
