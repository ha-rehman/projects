It serves as a tertiary referral hospital mainly for the Arab population of the Palestinian territories, namely the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and the Gaza Strip,[2] but also provides health care for the Israeli population when they meet obstacles using other facilities. It is a teaching hospital of Al-Quds University Faculty of Medicine.[3]
The hospital is part of the East Jerusalem Hospitals Network together with the Augusta Victoria Hospital, the Red Crescent Maternity Hospital (also called Palestinian Red Crescent Society Hospital), the Saint John Eye Hospital, the Princess Basma Rehabilitation Center, and St. Joseph's Hospital.[4][5] The network plays a crucial role in the Palestinian health care system.
Most of the staff and patients come the other side of the Israeli West Bank barrier which constantly causes difficulties for both groups reach the hospital.[6][7][8] The hospital provides accommodation for patients and their relatives from the Gaza strip for whom getting to the hospital is especially difficult.
