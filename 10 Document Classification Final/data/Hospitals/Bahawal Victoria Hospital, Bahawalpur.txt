Bahawal Victoria Hospital (Urdu: بہاول وکٹوریہ سپتال, abbreviated as BVH) is located in Bahawalpur, Pakistan, started functioning as a Civil Hospital with an outdoor department and a dispensary and an operating theatre in 1876. In 1906 this health unit was named Bahawal Victoria Hospital.[1] Now it is a hub of clinical expertise both in specialties as well as in sub-specialties with a multitude of patients visiting the hospital. In 1952, a benevolent extension of Nursing School was brought about with an anticipation to render rash and prompt basic health amenities. Classes leading to L.S.M.F were also started in 1956.[2][3][4][5] Its nexus with Quaid e Azam Medical College (QAMC) in 1970 has transformed it into one of the largest tertiary care facilities in the province of Punjab.
It is now a 2200-bedded, fully equipped, tertiary-care hospital with all medical and surgical specialities, serving large number of patients in the South Punjab.[6] It is facilitating undergraduate medical students of QAMC, nursing students of allied nursing school, paramedics and many post-graduate trainees.[7]
