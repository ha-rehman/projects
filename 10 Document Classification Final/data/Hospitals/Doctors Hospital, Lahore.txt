Doctors Hospital and Medical Center is a 250-bedded private hospital located in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. It is attached to Lahore Medical and Dental College as a teaching hospital.
In 1996, a small group of Pakistani doctors practicing in the United States held a retreat in Pennsylvania to discuss the creation of a new medical facility in Pakistan. These doctors moved back to Pakistan and started to build the Doctors' Hospital and Medical Center. Many colleagues of different specialties joined the core group and the hospital was established in 2000.[1]
