History[edit]
The hospital, located in Ahmedabad, was established in 1994 as a small six-bed single specialty unit that offered total knee replacement (TKR) surgery.[3]
Shalby Hospital[edit]
By 2007, it had become a 200-bed multi-specialty hospital. It works in 40 medical disciplines ranging from cardiology, cardiothoracic surgery, dental care, oncology and trauma to ENT.[3][4]
In 2011, it acquired a 55 per cent stake in the Vrundavan Hospital in Goa, which had 120 beds across two units.[5] In 2012 Shalby acquired Krishna Hospital for an estimated Rs 75 crore, to become the biggest private corporate hospital in Ahmedabad.[6] By 2012 the company had 450 beds in Ahmedabad.[7]
In 2013, Shah claimed the hospital in Ahmedabad completed an average of 30 joint replacement surgeries a day, at which point they had 705 employees.[8]
During the period 1994–2009, the joint replacement team performed more than 20,000 TKR procedures.[3] The length of surgical time in the hospital had been dramatically reduced from 1 hour, 20 mins per TKR to around 10–12 minutes[9] using the "ZERO Technique" invented by Dr. Vikram Shah.[10] Over the years, Shalby has performed over 1,00,000 Joint Replacement Surgeries.[11]
In 2011, Shalby received the Diplomat in National Board (DNB) certificate in Orthopaedics. At the time, it was the only hospital in Gujarat to have this.[12]
