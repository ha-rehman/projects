The Sehlabathebe National Park is located in the Maloti Mountains in Qacha's Nek District, Lesotho, and is part of the larger Maloti-Drakensberg World Heritage Site. Home to both striking biological diversity as well as important cultural heritage, the park was first established on May 8, 1969.[2] The landscape is dominated by grassland of various types. The larger ecosystem as a whole performs invaluable functions including providing freshwater to Lesotho, South Africa and Namibia.[3]

Geography[edit]
The park includes a wide range of features including cliffs, waterfalls, pools, rock dwellings and rock art, and a unique ecosystem of plants, animals, and birds.[7] It offers a significant habitat to a range of unique Afro-Alpine and Sub-Alpine plants, mammals, avifauna, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. It has spectacular scenery with unique rock formations. Most of the Park is taken up by a designated wilderness area and although small by international standards, it retains its natural character and is uninhabited.[8]
The Park is noted for its outstanding biodiversity. Some of the endemic species are endangered, including three vertebrate species:[8]
the Maluti redfin, Pseudobarbus quathlambae, a critically endangered species of fish which is endemic to the park
the cape vulture (Gyps coprotheres)
the bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus)
The Sehlabathebe water lily is an endangered aquatic plant.[9]
The Tsoelikanyane waterfall is the biggest waterfall in the park.[10]
This site hosts 23 percent of the plant species in the whole of Maluti Drakensberg area. The park has not only a unique floral presence in the park, but also a record number[clarification needed] of 65 rock art sites which have been identified, as well as other forms of previous habitation of the site.[citation needed]
World Heritage status[edit]
