The Lofa-Mano National Park is a proposed national park in Liberia. It was proposed in 1979. This site is 2,300 square kilometres (890 sq mi).[1] The park was proposed to protect an area of unexploited[2] forest in the north-west of the country, bordering Sierra Leone, an area described ecologically at the time as "certainly the most abundant in Liberia".[1] The national park area would complement the adjoining Gola Forest area of Sierra Leone.[3]
The forests are home to species of threatened birds,[1] and the Pan-African duiker.[4]
This area has a high value of biodiversity, where over 60 globally endangered species live, and it is also a critical corridor for wildlife.[5]
