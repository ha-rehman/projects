Faro National Park is a national park in Cameroon's North Province. It covers an area of 3,300 km2 (1,300 sq mi) and is close to the Nigerian border, surrounded on the eastern side by several hunting reserves.[1] It is home to cheetahs, black rhinoceros, elephants, and is known for its colonies of hippopotamuses.[2]
The park is enclosed between two large sandy, perennial rivers, the Faro on the north-east and the Déo along the western side, which flows into the Faro in the extreme north.[3]
