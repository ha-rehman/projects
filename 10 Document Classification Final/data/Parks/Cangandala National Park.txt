History[edit]
The park was created in 1963 while Angola was a territory under Portuguese rule. It was declared a national park on 25 June 1970. Cangandala was founded to protect the Giant Sable Antelope which were discovered in 1963.
Description[edit]
The park, which covers an area of 600 km2 (230 sq mi), consists of undulating sandlime hills with lowerlying drainage lines. The area receives about 1,350 mm (53 in) rainfall per year with an average temperature of 21.5 °C (71 °F). No perennial rivers occur and drainage takes place via grass covered waterlanes. A mosaic of open miombo bushveld and savanna occur. Brachystegia-bushveld are found on the water partitions and open grasslands in the lower-lying drainage lanes.
The red-lipped herald is one of the commonest snakes in the park.
Forest vegetation is dominated by Brachystegia and Julbernardia, together with other trees in places (Piliostigma, Burkea, Monotes, Strychnos, Sterculia and Dombeya).[1]
