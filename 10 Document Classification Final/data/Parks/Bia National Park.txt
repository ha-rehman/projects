Geography[edit]
Bia National Park is located near the Ivorian border, the Bia River, and its tributaries, which flow into the Côte d'Ivoire drainage area. It is found in the transitional zone between moist-evergreen and moist semi-deciduous forest types.[5] Access to the park from Kumasi is through Bibiani, Sefwi Wiawso to Sefwi Asempanaye or Goaso through Sankore to Sefwi Asempanaye. From Sunyani it can be reached through Brekum, Wanfi, Adabokrom and Debiso. From Côte d'Ivoire the park can be reached through Osei Kojokrom and Debiso.[3]
History[edit]
Bia was created in 1935 and named after the Bia River which drains the area.[6] It became an official national park in 1974.[7] Intensive farming destroyed much of the original vegetation in the park.[8] However, since 1975, no human activities like farming or logging have taken place.[9] In 1985 the park was named a biosphere reserve and a UNESCO world heritage site.[9]
Wildlife[edit]
There are 62 species of mammals (including 10 primate species which are the Black and White colobus, the olive colobus, red colobus monkeys and chimpanzees) are known to live in the park, and over 189 species of birds, including the endangered white-breasted guinea fowl, Black Collared lovebird, Cassin’s hawk Eagle, Honeyguide Greenbul, Black headed Oriole, Brown and Puvel’s illadopsis, finch’s flycatcher thrush, Grey Crown Negrofinch, Western Nicator, spotted Greenbul, Grey headed bristlebill, Fire bellied woodpecker, melancholy woodpecker among others can be found there.[10] The park is also the only known home of the newly discovered species of lizard, Agama sylvanus.[11] Ghana's major protected forest antelope communities also live in the park.[12] The forest elephant and the bongo which is claimed to be highly threatened can be found there.[3]
Activities[edit]
There are walking trails and roads which lead to the reserve of the forest. The wild animals and the birds can be spotted. Researchers, scientific and ecological studies can be done in the reserves as it creates opportunities for them. Snail can also be picked in the park.[3][13]
A cultural site called Apaso is located in the park closer to two small pools and it is claimed to be a sacred place to people who visit to sacrifice and give gifts to their gods.[7]
