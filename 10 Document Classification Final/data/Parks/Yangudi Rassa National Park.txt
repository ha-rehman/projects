This national park was proposed in 1977 in specific to protect the African wild ass, but the steps needed to officially establish this park had not been completed as of 2002. Recently, the wild ass became extinct in Yagundi Rassa. However, there is a small population in the adjacent Mile Serdo Wildlife Reserve (8,766 km2).[2]
The park headquarters are in Gewane. Large animals native to the park include gerenuk, Soemmerring's gazelle, East African oryx, Lion, Grevy's zebra, Cheetah and Leopard.[3] Bird species of interest include lesser flamingo, pale rockfinch and Arabian bustard.[4] The Awash-Asseb highway crosses the Yangudi Rassa National Park, as does the Awash River.
