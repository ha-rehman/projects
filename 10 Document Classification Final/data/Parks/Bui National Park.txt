The Bui National Park is found in Ghana. It was established in 1971. This site is 1821kmÂ².[1] It is located in a typical woodland savanna zone.[2] The reserve is notable for its large Hippopotamus population in the Black Volta. The endangered black and white colobus monkey and a variety of antelopes and birds are also present.[3] Part of the park has been inundated by the reservoir of the Bui Dam, which was constructed from 2007 to 2013.[4]
