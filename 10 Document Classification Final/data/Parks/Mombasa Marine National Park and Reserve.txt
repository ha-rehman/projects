Mombasa Marine National Park and Reserve is a marine park and national reserve in Mombasa, Kenya. The park is 10 km2 (2,500 acres) while the reserve is 200 km2 (49,400 acres).[1]
It is located on the coast near tourist areas and is a popular beach because of the snorkeling and diving. It is the most frequently visited of Kenya's marine parks. It has coral reefs in its waters. The reserve also provide a home to a variety of marine species including crabs, starfish, stone fish, cucumbers sea urchins, corals, turtles, sea grasses and migratory birds including crab plovers.[2]
It was established as a Marine Park in 1986, and encloses part of the lagoon, back reef and reef crest habitats of the Bamburi-Nyali fringing reef.
The Marine park is characterized by warm tropical conditions varying at the surface between 25 °C and 31 °C during the year, stable salinity regimes and moderate nutrient levels.
Due to the sensitivity of the ecosystems, and the endemic and endangered species found in the protected areas and the negative impacts of human influence, Mombasa Marine National Park and Reserve became protected.[3]
