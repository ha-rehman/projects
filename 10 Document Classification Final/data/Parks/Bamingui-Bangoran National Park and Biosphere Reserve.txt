Geography[edit]
The park and biosphere reserve complex is located in the country's centre-north, west of N'Délé and close to the border with Chad.[2] Reachable from Bangui, the capital city, it is situated to the west of Manovo-Gounda St. Floris National Park,[5] and holds a higher density and a larger number of wild animals than Manovo-Gounda.[4]
The national park is 1,070,000 ha in size, and lies within the mid-Sudanian phytogeographic domain of the Central African Republic.[6] The park is situated on a plateau at an elevation of 400 metres (1,300 ft) to 500 metres (1,600 ft) above sea level. Its waterways drain north-westwards to the Chari River.[7] The left bank floodplain of the Bamingui River is protected for 202 kilometres (126 mi) as are 105 kilometres (65 mi) of floodplain on the Bangoran River. A relatively small section, approximately 30 kilometres (19 mi) section on the Bangoran's right bank, is excluded from protection.[8]
The climate includes a rainy season of May–October in the southern reaches while diminishing to June–September in the northern areas. It can be muggy all year.[5]
Flora and fauna[edit]
Bamingui-Bangoran's major ecosystem is characterized as tropical dry or deciduous forests while the major habitats and land covers are dry forests, wooded savannas, edaphic savannas, and gallery forests.[9] Trees include the Terminalia, Isoberlinia doka and Anogeissus.[10]
The sub-specific endemism seen in the large mammals appears to link to Chari-Logone River system Pleistocene isolation.[6] One mammal is considered endangered, the Chadian wild dog, while the Sudan cheetah, Central African lion, and African manatee are classified as vulnerable. According to Spinage, antelope populations have declined markedly since 1960 within the park.[10]
The park reserve's amphibians include the Mascarene ridged frog, sharp-nosed ridged frog, Schilluk ridged frog, Galam white-lipped frog, cryptic sand frog, ornate frog, crowned bullfrog, flat-backed toad, shovelnose frog, Senegal kassina, and Natal puddle frog.[1] The red faced lovebird is found here and in Nigeria's Gashaka Gumti National Park.[11]
Threats[edit]
Ecological threats to the park reserve include foreign timber and mining concessions, poaching, and agriculture land-clearance.[5]
