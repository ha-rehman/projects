Semenawi Bahri National Park is a national park in Eritrea.
Made up of massive mountains as well as valleys, it is located at an altitude of between 900 and 2400 meters. A diverse range of wildlife live there, including duiker, klipspringer, warthog, leopard and bushbuck. Many species of birds have also been discovered recently.[1]
A single asphalted road traverses it to facilitate transportation. The Park is also equipped with recreation centers at Meguo, Medhanit and Sabur.[2] The Park is not well known to international and domestic tourists. However, its sights include rich flora and fauna, specifically bird-watching.[3]
