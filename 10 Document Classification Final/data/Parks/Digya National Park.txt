History[edit]
Digya National Park was created in 1900 as a protected area, the first in Ghana.[2] It was acquired by the government[5] and gazetted as a national park in 1971.[2] When the government acquired the park, there were living settlements in the park, with most of the residents being fishermen and farmers. In 2006, there were 49 settlements and the government of Ghana began evicting settlement residents from the park.[5] In early 2005, a patrol-based system was established in the park to curb illegal activity.[6]

The elephant population in the park is the second largest in Ghana.[8] Antelope species can he found at the park as well. There are also manatees and clawless otters in arms of Lake Volta that extend into Digya National Park. More than 236 species of birds live in the park.[2] This park is the only wildlife territory in Ghana to border on Lake Volta, the largest man-made body of water in the country.[2][7]
