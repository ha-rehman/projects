Sahara el Beyda, the White Desert Protected Area, is a national park in Egypt, first established as a protected area in 2002. It is located in the Farafra depression, 45 km north of the town of Qsar El Farafra. Part of the park is in the Farafra Oasis (New Valley Governorate).[1]
The park is the site of large white chalk rock formations, created through erosion by wind and sand. It is also the site of cliffs (at the northern end of the Farafra Depression), sand dunes (part of the Great Sand Sea), as well as Wadi Hennis and oases at Ain El Maqfi and Ain El Wadi.
The highest point in the park is at El Qess Abu Said (353 m above sea level) and the lowest is at Wadi Hennis (32 m).
The park serves as the refuge for various animals, including the endangered Rhim gazelle and the vulnerable Dorcas gazelle, as well as Barbary sheep; jackals; RÃ¼ppell's, red and fennec foxes; and the sand cat.
White Desert National Park covers an area of 3,010 km2. The altitude in the park varies from 32 to 353 metres above sea level.[2]
