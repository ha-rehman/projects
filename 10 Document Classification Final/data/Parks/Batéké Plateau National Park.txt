Fauna[edit]
In 2016, a single male lion was recorded in the National Park. Genetic analysis of his hair samples revealed that is closely related to historical lion specimens from this area and the neighbouring Republic of the Congo, which grouped with lion samples from Namibia and Botswana.[3]
Commercial hunting on the plateau in order to satisfy the markets in Congo and Gabon, especially large mammals, is a significant threat to the local fauna.[4]
