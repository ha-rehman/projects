History[edit]
The park became an Algerian National Park in 1984, and has been UNESCO-recognized as a biosphere reserve in 2004.[1]
Description[edit]
The park owes its name to the Gouraya Mountain (altitude 660m) located within the park's boundaries.[2] The ground elevation in the park oscillates between -135m and 660m. There is also a lake, the Lake Mézaïa.[1]
The park is located on a calcaro-dolomitic ground.[3]
The park is north-east of Béjaïa, close to the city. The park includes many beaches and cliffs, which make it a swimming destination for many Algerians.
Population[edit]
The permanent population in the Gouraya National Park is of Berber origins, 1,655 inhabitants across 13 villages.[1]
Wildlife[edit]
The park is home to a wide variety of flora and fauna, including Barbary macaques and jackals who live in the forests in this park. The Barbary macaque is a primate with a very restricted range in portions of northwestern North Africa and disjunctively in Gibraltar.[1]
