Name[edit]
The name of the mountain chain comes from the Kabyle word Jjerjer which means "great cold" or "elevation", from the old compound word Jer n Jer "the mountain of the mountains".[3] The Roman Empire used to call it Iron mountain in Latin (Mons Ferratus), in reference to the soil of the region, as well as to the resistance of the Kabyles against the Roman annexation of Kabylie. The name Djurdjura is also used for the villages located in this mountain chain. Mmis n'Djerdjer means "children of the Djurdjura", which is a Kabyle word referring to mountain inhabitants, there is also a Kabyle female group called DjurDjura.
