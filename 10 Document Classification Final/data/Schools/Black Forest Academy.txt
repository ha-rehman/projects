Academics[edit]
Black Forest Academy offers an international college-preparatory program, leading to a fully accredited US high school diploma. Students have the opportunity to take Honors and AP courses, as well as dual-credit courses available through BFA’s online learning program.
BFA has a wide range of co-curricular opportunities for students including music and drama programs, athletics, service opportunities, the National Honor Society, Student Council, and Model UN. BFA’s guidance department helps students with the college planning and application process. In addition, BFA’s campus is a site for PSAT, ACT, SAT and Advanced Placement (AP) testing. BFA offers academic support services for students through the Discovery Program and has an ELL (English Language Learner) program. As BFA is an international christian school, Bible is a mandatory class all students must complete in order to pass the year and graduate.
Boarding school[edit]
Over half of BFA’s high school students come to live in dormitories during the school year. BFA's Residence Life program has several dorm houses located in and around Kandern. Surrounded by forests and farmland of southern Germany, these residences are a safe place for students, many of whom have parents working in difficult regions. Dorms are staffed by dorm parents and resident assistants who partner with parents in the important task of preparing students for life after high school.
Elementary partnership[edit]
BFA partners with Freie Evangelische Schule in the operation of Christliche Schule Kandern, a bilingual school for grades 1-4.
