Introduction[edit]
The British School of Paris has provided a British education in Paris since 1954.[1] It is an independent fee-paying school with around 600 pupils, representing well over 50 nationalities. The British School of Paris is the only UK government accredited school in France.[2] The education programme is based on the National Curriculum for England and Wales[3] and its Patron is the serving British Ambassador to France.[4] The school is in the western suburbs of Paris in Croissy-sur-Seine.
History[edit]
Founded by Mary J, Cosyn in 1954,[5] the then 'English School of Paris' moved from its original Parisian address in that same year to the Château de Monte Cristo,[6] in Le Port-Marly just west of Paris, the former home of Alexander Dumas.
In the early years most pupils were British, American and Canadian with parents employed mainly by the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Powers in Europe (SHAPE). Following a spell in Andrésy and a brief return to the Chateau de Monte Cristo, the school moved again to its current home Llesna Court, 38 quai de l'Ecluse, Croissy-sur-Seine in 1964. By 1973 the school had acquired a second property in Bougival,[7] specifically to house the Junior School.
By 1980 the school had been transferred from private ownership to be established as an 'association' under French law as a 'not-for-profit' association.[8] A Board of Governors was appointed with responsibility for overseeing the running and development of the school and the British Ambassador to France[9] was adopted as the School Patron. By 1981 the school was officially renamed as The British School of Paris and in 2010 a purpose-built Junior School next to the Senior School campus was opened.[10]
