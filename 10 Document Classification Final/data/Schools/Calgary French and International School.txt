History[edit]
The Calgary French School (the predecessor to the Calgary French and International School) was founded after the passing of the Official Languages Act in September of 1969. Many mothers had practiced french on their own, and sought to establish an educational institution that could teach young in an all-French environment, called French immersion.[11]
Calgary French School began in church basements, and became a part of the Sacred Heart School in 1974. Throughout this time there was consistent growth in both student numbers and scholarly reputation. Over time, the community desired a space to call home. In late 1999, the shared space was reclaimed by its owners, so the school sought its own building. A campaign began to raise funds to purchase land and to construct a new site for the growing school.[11]
