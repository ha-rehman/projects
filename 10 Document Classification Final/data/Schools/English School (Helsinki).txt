The English School (Helsinki) is a private international school in Helsinki, Finland. It is a bilingual school, so most students can graduate according to Finnish and English school systems in the time students in either country would normally study according to their own system only.
The English School (TES) offers instruction in 2-year preschool/Kindergarten (5-6-years-olds), comprehensive school (classes 1-9) and high school. The curriculum follows the national guidelines, but places a special emphasis on both English and Finnish languages.
The school was founded by Catholic nuns in 1945.
