Accreditation[edit]
AIS Egypt is fully accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools (MSA).[4] AIS's American Diploma is not recognized by the Egyptian Ministry of Education, and so students from grade 1 and above start taking ministry subjects (one class Religious Studies/week, one class Egyptian Social Studies/week, and three classes of Arabic/week). When Arab students graduate, in addition to the American Diploma and the IB Diploma, they take the Egyptian General Certificate of Secondary Education. AISE is an IB World School,[5][6] and is also accredited by the European Council of International Schools, the Council of International Schools,[7] the Near East South Asia Council of Overseas Schools, the Mediterranean Association of International Schools, and the Associations for the Advancement of International Education.[8]
Curriculum[edit]
Qualified students in Grades 11 and 12 are offered the opportunity to earn a full International Baccalaureate Diploma[5] or IB Certificates. AIS Egypt also offers AP subjects in high school years.
