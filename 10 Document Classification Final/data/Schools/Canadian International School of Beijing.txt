Curriculum[edit]
CISB offers a Montessori Kindergarten from 18 months to 3 years old and an internationally recognized Canadian curriculum through an agreement with the New Brunswick, Canada, Department of Education.[6]
In the early years, the curriculum provides an emphasis on the skills, knowledge, and attitudes students will need for later success. As the students progress into Middle School, the subject areas broaden to provide them with experiences in specific curriculum areas and to introduce new interests. In High School, the program begins to become more focused as we prepare students to meet the requirements for university entrance.[7]
