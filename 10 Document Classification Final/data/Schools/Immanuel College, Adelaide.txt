History[edit]
Immanuel College was founded in 1895 at Point Pass (north of Eudunda, east of the Clare Valley[3]), before its subsequent move to North Adelaide in 1921. The founder was Pastor Georg Leidig and his eldest son Paul (correspondence in referenced book) taught there from 1950 until 1956.[4] During WWII, the buildings were required by the Air Force, and the college was forced to temporarily move to North Walkerville for the period 1942–1946. In 1949, land at Novar Gardens was acquired from the Morphett family property 'Cummins', and the school was eventually established there in 1957.[2] Cummins House was sold to the State Government in 1977, and Immanuel College leased that property for 5 years from 1982 to 1987.[5][6]
Sport[edit]
Immanuel College is a member of the Sports Association for Adelaide Schools (SAAS), and the Independent Girls Schools Sports Association (IGSSA).
Sports centre[edit]
To celebrate the 50th anniversary of its Novar Gardens campus, Immanuel College upgraded the school gymnasium. The sports centre includes a heated 25-metre 10-lane indoor swimming pool, a heated 15-metre by 6-metre hydrotherapy and learners pool, 3 indoor courts and a dance studio. A primary school oval was converted into the indoor basketball courts, and an existing auditorium and a new dance classroom were integrated into the new centre. Completed in 2008, the centre operates as an educational facility during the day,[7] and as a community sports centre after hours.
