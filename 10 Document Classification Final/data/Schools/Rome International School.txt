RIS is a meritocratic school: advancement is based on individual ability and achievement. Admission to the school is selective, subject to interview, entrance tests and reports from previous schools, and there are scholarships available for worthy international students.[6]
Early Years Department[edit]
The Nursery accepts children ages 2 and up.
The curriculum of the Kindergarten consists of programmes incorporating Language and Literacy, Mathematics, Personal, Social and Emotional Development, Physical Development, The Arts (drama, music, visual arts), and Units of Inquiry; these provide a trans-disciplinary approach to the teaching of Science and Technology and Social Studies and may incorporate Language and Mathematics and other subject areas where appropriate.
Transition class pupils continue working towards clearly defined learning targets, building on the work done in Kindergarten.[clarification needed]

Middle school[edit]
The school is not pursuing full implementation of the IB Middle Years Programme, however many of the fundamental concepts of the MYP are included in the Middle Years curriculum with the aim of developing the qualities of the IB Learner Profile.
The Middle School programme is a stimulating and varied curriculum that seeks to develop and enrich the learning skills formed in the Primary Programme. It draws learning material from a wide range of global contexts and the range of learning resources available for Cambridge Secondary Education.[10]
During the academic year 2015/16, the school introduced Cambridge Checkpoint for students in Grade 9, a diagnostic tool designed to assess learners at the end of the Middle Years.
The school offers a choice of French, Spanish or Chinese languages and also offers students the opportunity to follow an Italian curriculum to coincide with the international curriculum. At the end of Year 9 these students take the Italian state Licenza Media examinations.

High school[edit]
Grade 10 and 11 students follow the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) examinations at the end of Grade 11. Successful applicants can then enter the pre-university two year IB Diploma Programme.

Scholarships[edit]
As from the academic year 2010/2011, RIS has a Scholarship Fund Programme.
