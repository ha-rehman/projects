The British School of Kuwait (BSK) is a co-educational international school located in the suburb of Salwa, Kuwait. The school has a selective intake of students aged 4 to 18. Most teaching programmes are based on the National Curriculum of England. Year 10 and 11 students undertake programmes of study leading to GCSE and IGCSE. Sixth form students work towards Edexcel AS and A Level examinations.
History[edit]
Vera Al-Mutawa founded The Sunshine Kindergarten in 1978. This grew to become the Sunshine School. In 1993, the school moved to its present campus, opened to secondary age students and rebranded as The British School of Kuwait. Since 2008, Kindergarten students have been taught in a building adjacent to the BSK campus, for which the name The Sunshine Kindergarten was resurrected. In 2013, BSK was accredited as a British School Overseas (BSO) by the Department for Education in London. This accreditation was renewed in 2016.
