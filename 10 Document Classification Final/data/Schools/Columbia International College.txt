History[edit]
Founded in Hamilton, Ontario, in 1978, Columbia International College began as a six-room university preparatory and ESL school on Mohawk Road West. It was known at the time as Columbia Secondary School of Canada. The school quickly outgrew this location, prompting a move to 430 East 25th Street in 1981 and another move to 1029 Main Street West in 1985; by this time, Columbia had a student population of 300. Ten years later, in 1991, Columbia Secondary School officially changed its name to Columbia International College.
The 1990s saw growth in Columbia's facilities, academic programs and student population. The school's climb in enrollment numbers resulted in a relocation to the Ainsliewood Campus in 2000. The school's current home is an 11,200 square metre facility located at 1003 Main Street West.
