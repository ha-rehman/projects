Campus and curriculum[edit]
Annesley Junior School is located on a single campus in Wayville, opposite the Adelaide Parklands, 500 metres from the Adelaide CBD.[9] Notable facilities include the historic 'Gillingham Hall' seating the whole school and a Chapel.[10]
Annesley Junior School's academic programs include the Primary Years Program of the International Baccalaureate (IBPYP).
There are two intakes into reception each year, in terms one and three. This will continue from 2014 when South Australian government schools will move to a single intake.
History[edit]
Annesley Junior School was founded in 1902 as Methodist Ladies' College (MLC), at the site of the former Malvern Grammar School,[11] with 26 students enrolled. In 1903, the school was moved to the site of the former Way College for boys on Park Terrace (now Greenhill Road) at Wayville.[12]
In 1977, a Union of the Congregational, Methodist and Presbyterian Churches took place, forming the Uniting Church in Australia. MLC subsequently took the name Annesley College, the maiden name of Susanna Wesley, the mother of John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Church.
2010–2012: Merger talks, council resignation, transition to Junior School[edit]
In October 2010 Annesley College considered merging with another school due to declining enrolments over the previous seven years.[13] The Uniting Church stated it would guarantee the continuity of the school for the following two years and that no merger would proceed.[14] The school appointed former Melbourne Girls Grammar School principal Christine Briggs as its new principal[15] but she withdrew from the appointment days later.[16]
In the face of growing uncertainty the school said it was seeking formal discussion with Pulteney Grammar School regarding a merger,[17] but the Uniting Church shortly thereafter withdrew in favour of "the co-operation of another Uniting Church School".[18][19] It subsequently stated that Scotch College would take over its management. The existing school council resigned, stating that amalgamation would have provided a better outcome.[20]
By January 2011, 108 students remained enrolled, down from 466 students mid-2010,[4] and by June 2011 the school announced it would relaunch in 2012 as the Annesley Learning Community, offering a school for boys and girls from Reception to Year 6 (from 2012) and a women's college for Years 10 to 12 (from 2013),[21] with a commensurate drop in staff numbers from 29 to 13.[22] Year 10 to 12 tuition was not sustained and the college was renamed Annesley Junior School. In August 2012 there were 100 students enrolled.[23]
