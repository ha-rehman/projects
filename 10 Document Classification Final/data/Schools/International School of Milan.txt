History[edit]
Founded in 1958, the school initially offered the British O Levels/GCSE and A Levels. The International Baccalaureate was gradually adopted as the main curriculum after the Italian government recognized the IB as equivalent to the Maturit√† (the Italian equivalent of A Levels) during the late 1980s to early 1990s. The British curriculum is no longer taught and ISM is solely an IB World School.[2]
In September 2013, the school opened a brand-new purpose-built campus in Baranzate, northern Milan which united the Primary, Middle and High School sections of the school.[3]
International School of Europe[edit]
The network was founded in 2008. ISM, as well as its sister schools in Monza (1984), Rome (1988) and Modena (1998), are part of the network. In 2010, ISE opened another school in Siena as part of a joint venture with Novartis Vaccines, Monte Dei Paschi and the provincial government of Siena.[2]
