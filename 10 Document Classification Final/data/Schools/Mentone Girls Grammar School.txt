History[edit]
Mentone Girls' Grammar School was established in 1899 as the Mentone High School for Girls, by the four Simpson sisters at "Cobbalanna", in Como Parade, Mentone. "Cobbalanna" is now the name given to the new Senior College.[10] In 1924, the school was re-opened as the Mentone Girls' Grammar School (St. Margaret's) under the leadership of the then headmistress, Evaline Mary Pearson.[10]
Mentone Girls' Grammar became affiliated with the Church of England in 1962, and subsequently the bishop's mitre was added to the school crest.[10] Parts of the campus are named after recent headmistresses and headmaster. For example, the Prudence Lewty hall was named after former headmistress Prudence Lewty.
Campus[edit]
Mentone Girls' Grammar School is located on single campus[11] in suburban Mentone, directly adjacent to Mentone Beach.[12] Features of the campus include: a pre–tertiary learning centre for students in Years 11 and 12 known as the "Cobbalanna Senior College", the Junior School with specialised facilities, the Simpson Art Centre with facilities for photography and ceramics, "The Bay Cafe" is a cafeteria style lunch space, the David Hunt centre (named after the former Head Master) utilized for performing arts, the Annette Kellerman science wing and pool, named for the underwater ballerina of the same name, whose mother was a member of staff at the school during the 1920s, library, multi-media laboratories, and performing arts spaces.[13] Sporting facilities include tennis courts, a gymnasium,[14] a 25-metre outdoor heated swimming pool and a smaller indoor heated pool used by the ELC and Prep students.[15]
The school also makes use of outside facilities such as Mentone Beach.[16]
Recently Mentone Girls' Grammar released their plans for the Wellbeing Precinct, transforming one third of the entire campus to make way for facilities such as an indoor pool with diving boards, multi-purpose courts for netball and basketball, and a synthetic multi-use pitch for soccer, hockey and tennis.[17]
School crest[edit]
The Mentone Girls' Grammar School crest was designed in 1924, by Headmistress, Mary Pearson. To complement the school crest, Pearson developed the school motto of Vero Nihil Verius, which may be translated from Latin as "Nothing truer than Truth".
The crest is based on the design of St. George's shield, and is made up of four components:
The three stars represent the Holy Trinity: God the Father; God the Son and God the Holy Spirit.
The three wavy gold lines symbolise the school's location by a bay.
The bishop's mitre was added in 1963 to signify the School's association with the Anglican Church of Australia.
The colours of murrey, blue and gold, also add significance. Murrey, a traditional heraldic colour, represents the blood of Christ. Blue represents both the sky and the water and indicates the height and depth of learning. Gold represents the sands of the shore.
Former Headmistress, Prudence Lewty and Bursar Mary Coxall added a laurel wreath around the crest in 1963. In heraldic terms, the laurel wreath identifies heroes returning from battle and technically should only be displayed on crests which have been carried into battle. For this reason the laurel wreath was removed in 1999.[18]
