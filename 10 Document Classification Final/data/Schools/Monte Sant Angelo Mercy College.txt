History[edit]
Monte Sant'Angelo is the oldest independent girls' school on Sydney's north shore. The College was established in 1865, on the corner of Miller and McLaren Street, North Sydney, by Mother Ignatius McQuoin of the Sisters of Mercy.[9] By 1879, the school had outgrown its original site and subsequently moved to its current location at Miller Street. The name of the College is taken from Monte Sant'Angelo, a centre of religion, culture and learning in Gargano, Italy.[9]

Musicals[edit]

In 2009, the Broadway musical Les Misérables was performed with a collaboration from Aloys and St. Mary's male students. The school musicals are performed every second year.
In 2012 Monte collaborated with local boys schools to produce a stage version of Beauty and the Beast and in 2014, Hairspray. In 2018 Monte collaborated with other local boys' schools for their production of High School Musical. In March 2020 the school was due to produce several performances of Wicked, which were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
House plays[edit]
House plays are musicals that each colour house choreographs and later performs. The plays are run by the year eleven students, who choose music, dance routines, story line and performance costumes for their house. Practices are held on Fridays and Saturdays at the school. The performance is generally held on a Saturday, with a matinee performance added to the schedule in 2009. The criteria of House Plays are usually the theme and message, but visuals and music are also judged.
Houses[edit]
Monte has six colour houses named after patron saints and prominent Sisters of Mercy. These houses compete against each other in school events such as Swimming Carnivals, Athletics Carnivals and House Plays.
