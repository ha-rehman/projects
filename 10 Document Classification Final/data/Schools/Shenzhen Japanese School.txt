History[edit]
Around 2004 the Shenzhen Japanese Chamber of Commerce suggested establishing a Japanese school.[2] Shenzhen Fuji Xerox and several other Japanese companies sponsored the Japanese school. It was scheduled to begin operations in April 2008.[6] On April 23, 2008 the Ministry of Education of China approved the establishment of the school.[7] The school opened on Friday June 13, 2008. At that time the school had 39 students and 17 teachers.[2] The school initially occupied an area on the second floor of the Haitao Hotel[note 2] in Shekou. The school was scheduled to move out within three years and take a permanent facility.[6]
