History[edit]
In 1965, Barbara Goodwin-Zeibots established The York School as a nursery school. In 1978, the school added a toddler program as well as an elementary school. The first Grade 8 class graduated in 1985. The Senior School was founded in 1995 with the addition of a Grade 9 class.
In the late 1990s, 1320 Yonge Street was purchased through the "Home of Our Own" capital campaign. In September 2010, The York School opened a second campus at 1639 Yonge Street, which houses the Junior School (JK-Grade 5).
Goodwin-Zeibots remained the Head of School until retiring in the spring of 2006. She was succeeded by Ezio Crescenzi.[1] In 2011, Conor Jones became Head of School.
The location at 1320 Yonge Street houses the Middle and Senior School campus for Grades 6-12. In 2015, The York School celebrated its 50th anniversary and announced a Capital Campaign to raise $5 million for the renovation of the Middle and Senior School campus at 1320 Yonge Street. The renovation is now complete.[2]
In April 2019, Conor Jones resigned as head of school and Struan Robertson stepped in as interim head of school until December 2019, when he was appointed as full-time head of school.

Curricular and Co-Curricular Programmes[edit]
The York School offers a programme for Grade 9 students called ICE (Integrated Canadian Experience), exploring Canadian history, geography, civics and literature and what it means to be Canadian. All Grade 9 students participate in this intensive programme and produce a documentary to reflect on their learning at the end of the year. The documentary is screened by parents and educators.
The York School sends a group of Grade 11 student volunteers to the Global Pathways School in India, which was co-founded by Barbara Goodwin-Zeibots.
There is a one-week excursion for all students grade 6 through 10 called Challenge Week where students travel somewhere in Canada or the United States and do a week of learning about a specific subject.
All students and staff are part of a house system named after four important figures in Canadian history, including two women and two men to reflect the co-ed nature of the school. The four houses are called McClung, Champlain, Simcoe and Johnson, named after Nellie McClung, Samuel de Champlain, John Simcoe and Pauline Johnson.
