History[edit]
Pakistan International School of Cairo opened in 1982. The school primarily sought to cater to the needs of children of the Pakistani community living in Cairo. However, in order to maintain the optimal teacher-student ratio in every class, the school opened its doors to the children of other expatriates. Pakistan International School of Cairo is operated by a Board of Governors, which is chaired by the Ambassador of Pakistan to Egypt. Every effort is made to select members of the board from different walks of life, to benefit from their experiences and ideas. Preference is given to the community but parent representatives are also welcomed.
