The newer Senior Hall (Balmacewen House) is where common rooms and bedrooms are for year 11, 12 and 13 boarders.
International Baccalaureate[edit]
John McGlashan College has been an IB World School since December 1999. It is the only school in Dunedin that offers the IB Diploma Programme.[citation needed]
In 2011, 4 female students studied at the college full-time. Their original school, private Anglican girls' school, St Margaret's College, had been damaged in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. While being officially enrolled at nearby state integrated Anglican girls' school St Hilda's Collegiate School, the girls took classes at McGlashan as it was the only other IB school in the South Island.[6]
