Structure[edit]
The school is organised around five sub-schools that are designed to break down the large size of the school. They are named after local islands:
Bribie (red) after Bribie Island
Stradbroke (yellow) after Stradbroke Island
Fraser (green) after Fraser Island
Moreton (blue) after Moreton Island
Mudjimba (purple) after Mudjimba Island, established in 2019
Consequently, each academic cohort of about 275 students in the middle school is taught by the same group of about 25 teachers, who are also responsible for pastoral care. The school is therefore able to offer all the benefits of a large school like a broad range of subject choice and co-curricular activities while enjoying the advantages of a small school such as close personal relationships between teachers and students.
The school community is supported by The Creeker Foundation, the P&C Association, the Local Chaplaincy Committee (with two resident chaplains) and a strong network of community groups, including Lions Mooloolaba, Life Church Sunshine Coast, Goodlife Community Centre and Redfrogs Australia.
In 2015, the school began educating year 7 students. It has a strict catchment restriction.[3]
Expertise[edit]
In 2000, the school was recognised as one of Queensland's most progressive and innovative as a winner of Education Queensland's Showcase For Excellence Award.[4]
International[edit]
The school's major objective is to bring a greater international focus to its curriculum and operations. To this end, the school maintains the prestigious International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme,[5] supports a 5% international student population, and delivers international exposure trips across departments in Asia, Europe and Latin America. It is a long-term member of the Council of International Schools Australia.[2]
Innovation[edit]
In 2018, the school began construction of a 3-storey, multi-million dollar, multi-purpose building. In 2019 the building, named The Leading Edge was opened, and features state-of-the-art science laboratories and a digital technology hub.[6] The school facilitates the Coding and Innovation Hub as part of the Sunshine Coast's innovation ecosystem.[7] The Hub delivers training to students and staff on STEM concepts, digital creativity, and program development. In 2019, the school established a pilot eSports program.
