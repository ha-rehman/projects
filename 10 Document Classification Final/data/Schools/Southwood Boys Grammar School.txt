History[edit]
Southwood accepted boys from prep to year 6 in 1999. In its first years, Southwood had 42 students from prep to year 6. Early on, Southwood only had one building (previously housing the junior school), which it obtained from the government primary school that previously occupied the site. A gymnasium, resource centre and new classrooms were later constructed.
Head of campus[edit]
The head of campus was the highest permanent position at Southwood (with only the Tintern Schools' Principal and Deputy Principal being higher). Adam Kenny was the final Head of Campus, assuming the position following Mike Philips, who left to return to study, who followed Peter Harte who left in 2009.

During 2008, Andrew Worner announced that he would be leaving the teaching profession to further enhance his professional development. Following Worner's resignation; Jenny Collins announced that in 2009 the Head of Campus position would undergo changes, so that the responsibilities would be shared by three people; the Middle School and Senior College coordinators and the new Head of Campus (Operations) position.
The staff fulfilling these positions in 2009 were:

Song[edit]
In 2005, the school song, titled 'Southwood Boys' was written by Paul Jarman, an Australian musician and was dedicated to Mike Blood, the head of campus at the time. The song was sung as part of the school's annual presentation night, the annual induction ceremony and at other important events.
