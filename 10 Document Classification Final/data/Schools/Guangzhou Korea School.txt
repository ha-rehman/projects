Guangzhou Korea School (Chinese: 广州韩国学校, Korean: 광저우한국학교) is a South Korean international school within the Jinxiuxiangjiang Primary School[note 1] located within the Jinxiuxiangjiang Apartment[note 2] in Nancun Town[note 3], Panyu District, Guangzhou.[1][2]
In 2011 Kim Jang-hwan, the consul general of South Korea to Guangzhou, revealed that a Korean international school was opening in Guangzhou.[3] Many Koreans lived in Panyu District so the school was scheduled to be located there.[4] The Chinese Ministry of Education approved the school as a school for teaching foreigners on July 24, 2013.[5]
