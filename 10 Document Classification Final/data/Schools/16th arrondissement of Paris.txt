The 16th arrondissement of Paris (XVIe arrondissement) is one of the 20 arrondissements of the capital city of France. In spoken French, this arrondissement is referred to as seizième.
The arrondissement includes part of the Arc de Triomphe, and a concentration of museums between the Place du Trocadéro and the Place d'Iéna, complemented in 2014 by the Fondation Louis Vuitton.[2]
With its ornate 19th-century buildings, large avenues, prestigious schools, museums, and various parks, the arrondissement has long been known as one of French high society's favourite places of residence (comparable to London's Kensington and Chelsea or Berlin's Charlottenburg)[3] to such an extent that the phrase le 16e (French pronunciation: [lə sɛzjɛm]) has been associated with great wealth in French popular culture. Indeed, the 16th arrondissement of Paris is France's third richest district for average household income, following the 7th, and Neuilly-sur-Seine, both adjacent.[4]
The 16th arrondissement hosts several large sporting venues, including: the Parc des Princes, which is the stadium where Paris Saint-Germain football club plays its home matches; Roland Garros Stadium, where the French Open tennis championships are held; and Stade Jean-Bouin, home to the Stade Français rugby union club. The Bois de Boulogne, the second-largest public park in Paris (behind only the Bois de Vincennes), is also located in this arrondissement.

Demographics and politics[edit]
The 16th arrondissement population peaked in 1962, when it had 227,418 inhabitants. At the last census (2009), the population was 169,372. The 16th arrondissement contains a great deal of business activity; in 1999 it hosted 106,971 jobs.
The 16th arrondissement is commonly thought to be one of the richest parts of Paris (see Auteuil-Neuilly-Passy), and features some of the most expensive real estate in France including the famous Auteuil "villas",[note 1] heirs to 19th century high society country houses, they are exclusive gated communities with huge houses surrounded by gardens, which is extremely rare in Paris. It is also the only arrondissement in Paris to be divided into two separate postal codes. The southern part of the arrondissement carries a postal code of 75016, while the northern part has the code of 75116.
Politics
The 16th arrondissement is one of the strongest areas in the country for the French right. In 2017, it gave over 58% of its votes in the first round to right-wing candidate François Fillon; amidst a poor national result of only 20%. It then went on to vote for Emmanuel Macron by a landslide in the runoff.

1 This group is made up largely of former French settlers, such as Pieds-Noirs in Northwest Africa, followed by former colonial citizens who had French citizenship at birth (such as was often the case for the native elite in French colonies), as well as to a lesser extent foreign-born children of French expatriates. Note that a foreign country is understood as a country not part of France in 1999, so a person born for example in 1950 in Algeria, when Algeria was an integral part of France, is nonetheless listed as a person born in a foreign country in French statistics.
2 An immigrant is a person born in a foreign country not having French citizenship at birth. Note that an immigrant may have acquired French citizenship since moving to France, but is still considered an immigrant in French statistics. On the other hand, persons born in France with foreign citizenship (the children of immigrants) are not listed as immigrants.

Marcel Petiot[edit]
A notorious serial murder case, which generated an international media circus, centered in the 16th arrondissement during the Nazi occupation of France during World War II. The focal point of the case was French doctor Marcel Petiot, who in 1941 bought a house at 21 Rue le Sueur in "the heart of Paris's fashionable 16th arrondissement".[13] On 11 March 1944, Petiot's neighbors complained to police of a foul stench in the area and of large amounts of smoke billowing from a chimney of the house. Fearing a chimney fire, the police summoned firemen, who entered the house and found a roaring fire in a coal stove in the basement. In the fire, and scattered in the basement, were human remains.[13] Following an investigation, during which time Petiot attempted to evade capture, "the monster of rue Le Sueur" was ultimately arrested and went on trial on 19 March 1946, facing 135 criminal charges. He was convicted of 26 counts of murder and sentenced to death. On 25 May, Petiot was beheaded, after a stay of several days due to a problem in the release mechanism of the guillotine. [13][14][15]
