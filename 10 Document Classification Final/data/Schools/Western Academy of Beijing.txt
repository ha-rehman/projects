Founded in 1994 Western Academy of Beijing (WAB, simplified Chinese: 北京京西国际学校; traditional Chinese: 北京京西國際學校; pinyin: Běijīng Jīngxī Guójì Xuéxiào[2][3]) is an international school located in Beijing.[4] The school provides education from Early Years 3 to Grade 12. WAB uses the IB PYP (IB Primary Years Program) until Grade 5, IB MYP (IB Middle Years Program) up to and including Grade 10, and the IB DP (IB Diploma Program) for Grades 11 and 12.
WAB was an Olympic Educational Model School for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. Out of the 500 schools across China, who were awarded by Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games as an Olympic Educational Model School, WAB was among the top 120 schools.[5]
In 2013 Mike Embley, the headmaster of the British School of Beijing (BSB), stated that along with BSB and the International School of Beijing (ISB), WAB was one of the top three English-language international schools in Beijing, all having long waiting lists.[6] Citing Embley's definition of two lower tiers of Beijing Anglophone international schools which have vacant student spaces, Tristan Bunnell, the author of The Changing Landscape of International Schooling: Implications for Theory and Practice, stated that this was an instance of the idea of " 'superior' and 'inferior' schools" shared by teachers and parents.[7]
