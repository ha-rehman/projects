Canberra Grammar School is a co-educational, independent, day and boarding school, located in Red Hill, a suburb of Canberra, the capital of Australia.
The school is affiliated with the Anglican Church of Australia and provides an education from pre-school to Year 12 for boys and girls. In October 2015, the school announced that it would extend co-education to all years, commencing in 2016 with an intake of girls in Years 3 and 4. By 2018 the school became fully co-educational.[4]
The school was founded in 1929 when the existing Monaro Grammar School was relocated to Canberra from Cooma.[5] The foundation stone was laid on 4 December 1928 by Prime Minister Stanley Bruce. Initially it was attended by only 63 students, but has grown considerably since the early 1950s to a total attendance of 1,749 students as of June 2015.[6]
The school has educated one Australian Prime Minister and has a long list of notable alumni.
This school consists of 5 main campuses: Red hill Southside, Red hill Primary, Red hill Senior, Early Learning center-(ELC), and Northside Campell ACT- only years Pre school to year 2.

Curriculum[edit]
In the primary school, the Australian Curriculum and Early Years Learning Framework requirements are incorporated through International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme.[7]
In the senior school, from years 7 to 10, the school follows the Australia Curriculum and the ACT Every chance to learn curriculum framework.[8] Unlike other schools in the Australian Capital Territory, Canberra Grammar School does not follow the ACT Year 12 Curriculum. Instead, students in years 11 and 12 have the option to study either the New South Wales Higher School Certificate (HSC) or the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme.[9] In 2012, Canberra Grammar became an International Baccalaureate World School.[10]
