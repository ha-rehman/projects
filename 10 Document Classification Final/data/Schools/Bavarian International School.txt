History and facilities[edit]
BIS was founded in 1990 as a non-profit association to serve the international community in the north of Munich. The school opened its doors in Schwabing on 19 February 1991 with just six students[3] and grew steadily, with its first graduating class in 1997.
In 1998 the school moved to Schloss Haimhausen, a Rococo mansion located about ten kilometers north of Munich. Several purpose-built facilities, including a cafeteria, a performance arts center with 510 seats,[4] a sports hall and 8-lane track were added to the school site over the following years. To make BIS-education more easily accessible for children living in the city, the BIS City Campus Primary School was opened for students in January 2016. In January 2017 about 200 children in EC1 (age 4) to Grade 5 were enrolled at the new campus, which has a capacity of 500 students.
