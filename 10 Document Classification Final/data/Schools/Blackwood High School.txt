Performing Arts Centre[edit]
The Performing Arts Centre (PAC), the Auditorium, or the Blackwood Community Recreation Centre, was constructed in 2001 with funds raised in several schools and community-based fund-raisers.[5] It features several sound-proofed rooms, computing equipment, musical instruments, and a large theatre and stage, with a booth for controlling the lighting and sound effects. The PAC is also used by the community as a church on Sunday mornings.
The main auditorium seats about 350, with the capability to have an extended stage because of retractable seating. In addition to the main performing areas, the PAC boasts a recording studio, four small practise rooms, two classrooms, offices, and storerooms.
