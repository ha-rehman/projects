The British International School, Cairo (BISC) is a private British school in Beverly Hills, a compound within the 6th of October City, in Greater Cairo, Egypt.[1]
BISC was previously in Zamalek.[2] It moved from its Zamalek location in September 2008 to its new purpose built campus in the residential compound of Beverly Hills.[citation needed] BISC has an extensive campus with facilities including a theatre, Olympic swimming pool and age appropriate learning spaces for all students.
BISC is an independent, fee-financed, not for profit school authorised by the Ministry of Education. The Good Schools Guide International states that the school "offers a world class education – the best in Egypt – and prestige. To be a BISC graduate certainly says something."[3] The school is regularly inspected by BSO and is one of only a handful of schools certified by COBIS within Egypt.
