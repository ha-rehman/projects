History[edit]
The school was founded in 2003.[5] It was originally intended to open in September 2004, but it opened on 29 March 2004 as prospective families were already in Beijing.[6]
Originally both Nord Anglia campuses in Beijing, Shunyi and Sanlitun, were operated as a single school, The British School of Beijing (北京英国国际学校). In 2013 they were administratively made into separate institutions.[5]
Curriculum[edit]
The school offers an enhanced British National Curriculum. The curriculum is taught by UK qualified teachers and supported by teaching assistants.[7] The school prepares students for the IGCSE, and IB Diploma Programme.
Students in the primary levels study Mandarin Chinese and may choose to take a second foreign language. Secondary students must study Mandarin and another foreign language.[4]
The school offers a German Primary Programme for German-speaking primary school students in Klasse 1 to 4 to study core subjects in German, following the Thuringia Curriculum, while integrating into the British National Curriculum with non-core subjects and a variety of whole school activities.[8]
Operations[edit]
Jonathan Stefonek of the China Daily stated that "The British School operates more formally than the larger international schools in Shunyi".[3] Warwick Mansell of The Telegraph wrote that the school "presents itself as stressing old-fashioned courtesy and not tolerating poor behaviour."[4]
BSB, as of 2013, sends teachers to rural China to help area Chinese students, and teachers from rural China go to BSB to get assistance. The Chinese central government had selected BSB for this role.[3]
Student body[edit]
As of 2011 the whole BSB school had 1,150 students from 50 countries. Many of the parents work for embassies and/or multinational corporations. The British made up the largest group of students at BSB, about 25% of the total. The Mainland European nationalities together totaled 30%, and the third-largest grouping originated from North America.[4]
As of 2016, BSB Shunyi's maximum capacity is 1500 students and students came from over 60 nationalities including British, German, American, South Korean and Hong Kong etc. [9]
Location[edit]
The British School of Beijing has two campuses. The Sanlitun campus comprises two buildings in downtown Beijing in the Embassy district. One building caters for Pre-Nursery and Nursery students (age 2 – 4), the other is from Reception to Year 6 (age 5 – 11).[2] The other larger campus is situated in the rural area of Shunyi, approximately 45 minutes out of central Beijing.[1] This campus caters for students from Pre-Nursery to Sixth Form College (18 months – 18 years).[2]
Facilities[edit]
Both Nord Anglia schools host a wide range of facilities including a library, a gymnasium, a football pitch, tennis and basketball courts, and indoor sports dome. There is a theatre in each school,[10] and a 230-seat amphitheatre in the Shunyi school.[4] The Shunyi school also hosts tennis courts, an indoor swimming pool,[4] fitness suite, dance studio, dedicated music rooms plus numerous private practice rooms, computer music suites, a recording studio, ICT suites, a Lego robotics lab, science laboratories and art studios.[10] The Sanlitun school uses an Astroturf play area, and it has a football (soccer) pitch on the roof.[4]
Mansell wrote that the Sanlitun campus "is said by the school to have a “cosy” family feel".[4]
As of 2014 one of the BSB schools has an inflatable dome for athletics events in order to shield students from Beijing pollution.[11]
School governance[edit]
The schools are part of the Nord Anglia Education group, a British organisation founded in 1972 specialising in education.[12]
