The New Kuwait Philippines International School (abbreviated as, NKPIS) is a private school located at Jleeb Al-Shuyoukh, Kuwait. It is one of the two Philippine schools in Kuwait.
History[edit]
The NKPIS was established in 1999 by Om Al-Qura Education Establishment and obtained a permit from the Kuwaiti government in 2004.[1] Khalifa Talal Al-Jeri established the institution to provide education to Filipino children based from the Educational Curriculum of Philippines. The only Philippine School in Kuwait had undergone several accreditation and inspections by the Department of Education (DepEd) and the Commission on Filipino Overseas (CFO), Philippines. Thus, the NKPIS became the first Philippine School abroad who was given a license to operate and pilot the Grade 11 and 12 Program of the Department of Education, Manila, Philippines.[citation needed]
The Ministry of Education of Kuwait cancelled NKPIS' permit to operate in 2008 due to the government's decision to use the land where the school operates. NKPIS is within the premises of the Hassan Bin Thabit Kindergarten. However the ministry allowed the school to remain open in 2011 at least until 2018.[1][2]
