History[edit]
William Henry Fitchett was secretary of a committee formed in 1879 to start a secondary school for girls.[11] MLC was founded on its current campus in Kew on 14 February 1882 as a modern school of the first order, with buildings that formed a collegiate institution for girls unsurpassed in the colonies.[citation needed] It was the first Australian girls' school established by the Wesleyan Methodists and Fitchett was the first principal. The goal of its founders was to provide a high-class Christian education for girls, comparable with that provided elsewhere for boys.[citation needed] As the first Australian girls' school established by the Wesleyan Methodists, MLC attracted boarders from all Australian colonies.[citation needed]
In 1990, MLC became the first school in the world to introduce laptop computers for all students from Year 5 to Year 12.[12] In 1991, MLC Marshmead opened, providing Year 9 students with an eight-week residential experience with a focus on outdoor education.[citation needed]
In 2001, The Sun-Herald reported a 1988 study which ranked MLC third in Australia's top ten girls' schools, based on the number of its alumni mentioned in the Who's Who in Australia (a listing of notable Australians).[13][a] In 2002, MLC won the title of 'Australian School of the Year', as published in The Australian newspaper.[5]
House system[edit]
As with most Australian schools, MLC has a house system through which students partake in inter-house competitions and activities. The college currently has five houses:
Berry - Colour: Purple, Mascot: Turtle.
Cato - Colour: Blue, Mascot: Bear.
Fitchett - Colour: Yellow, Mascot: Lion
Krome - Colour: Green, Mascot: Frog
Nevile - Colour: Pink, Mascot: Pink Panther
In the past, there was a Tiddeman house (colour red), which was specifically for boarders.
Curriculum[edit]
MLC offers an extensive range of VCE and Vocational Education Training (VET) courses, as well as the IB Diploma Programme. It has one of the largest VCE subject selections in the state. The school's success with the IB Programme is internationally renowned, with students consistently achieving in the top global percentile each year. Its physical education program includes a wide variety of summer and winter sports. It participates in the Girls Sport Victoria competition.
The music school features an auditorium, and a department for woodwind, strings, keyboard, percussion and brass, with multiple ensembles including a concert orchestra, senior strings, choirs and bands. The music school is known for its excellence. The state of the art auditorium is often used for external performances.
The school offers a speech and drama program from early years and theatre arts and drama at VCE level, as well as a variety of studio arts subjects.

Indigenous programmes[edit]
MLC works with the Yalari scholarship programme to support Indigenous girls from regional, rural and remote communities to study and board at MLC. Yalari is a not-for-profit organisation that offers secondary education scholarships at leading Australian boarding schools.[15][16] MLC includes Indigenous issues in its mainstream curriculum, maintains a student Aboriginal Reconciliation Committee, grows an Indigenous garden, and appoints a senior Year 12 prefect to an Indigenous portfolio. MLC holds annual sporting and cultural exchanges with Worowa Aboriginal College at Healesville, Victoria.[17][18]

Controversy[edit]
In September 2012 the school board sacked the then principal of 15 years, Rosa Storelli, leading to calls by Storelli plus many parents and Old Collegians for the board's dismissal.[29] There were also protests outside the school by parents and students. The action by the board was made possible by changes to the school's constitution. This became a cautionary tale for other independent schools in Australia about the relationship between principals and the boards of those schools and the power-sharing relationships among the various stakeholders. By 2017 most members of that board had been replaced. Rosa Storelli is currently a senior academic at La Trobe University.[30]
