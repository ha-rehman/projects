History[edit]
The school was founded in 1974, making it one of the oldest international schools in Beijing.
In 2005, eight North Koreans entered the school property in an attempt to get asylum.[6]
In 2010, the school canceled its sports day because it fell on September 18, and rescheduled it for October 10. This is because September 18 was the anniversary of the Mukden Incident in 1931.[7]
